Faults
======

.. req:: GET /{entity}/faults
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_012
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults

   The endpoint shall return the list of diagnostic fault entries stored for the addressed entity, possibly including active and stored faults.

.. req:: GET /{entity}/faults/{code}
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_013
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults, SOVD

   The endpoint shall return detailed information for the addressed diagnostic fault code,
   including environment data captured at fault confirmation.

   Response includes:

   - ``item``: Fault details with SOVD-compliant ``status`` object (aggregatedStatus, testFailed, confirmedDTC, pendingDTC)
   - ``environment_data``: Extended data records (timestamps) and snapshots array
   - ``environment_data.snapshots[]``: Array of freeze_frame (topic data) and rosbag (bulk-data reference) entries
   - ``x-medkit``: Extension fields (occurrence_count, reporting_sources, severity_label)

.. req:: DELETE /{entity}/faults
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_014
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults

   The endpoint shall clear all diagnostic fault entries stored for the addressed entity, if permitted.

.. req:: DELETE /{entity}/faults/{code}
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_015
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults

   The endpoint shall clear the addressed diagnostic fault code for the entity, if permitted.

.. req:: Per-Entity Debounce Thresholds
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_095
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults

   The fault manager shall support per-entity debounce threshold configuration using
   longest-prefix matching on the reporting entity's ``source_id``. Entity-specific
   overrides for ``confirmation_threshold``, ``healing_enabled``, and ``healing_threshold``
   shall take precedence over global defaults. Unspecified fields shall inherit from global
   configuration. When no entity prefix matches, global defaults shall apply.

.. req:: Configurable STALE Severity
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_109
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults

   The diagnostic bridge shall map a ``DiagnosticStatus`` of level STALE to a configurable
   fault severity, defaulting to CRITICAL, with per-diagnostic overrides selected by longest
   matching prefix on the status name. A STALE status resolving to a non-CRITICAL severity
   shall be subject to debounce filtering like any other report. An override that does not
   name a valid severity shall be reported and ignored, leaving the configured default in
   force.

.. req:: Reporter-Supplied Fault Evidence
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_110
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults

   A FAILED fault report shall be able to carry key-value measurements, which the fault
   manager shall retain in the fault's freeze frame under a reserved key distinct from
   captured topic values, and serve with the fault's environment data. Evidence shall be
   retained across reports that carry none, preserved when a confirmation capture rebuilds
   the frame, and bounded per fault code in entry count and value length, with entries
   exceeding a bound dropped whole and reported rather than truncated.

.. req:: Fault Snapshot and Rosbag Capture
   :id: REQ_INTEROP_088
   :status: verified
   :tags: Faults, BulkData

   When a fault is confirmed, the system shall automatically capture diagnostic snapshots
   (freeze-frame topic data) and rosbag recordings as configured. Captured data shall be
   stored as environment data associated with the fault and accessible via the bulk-data
   endpoints on the fault's reporting entity. For faults already confirmed when the
   capturing component starts (e.g. the gateway restarts while a fault is standing), an
   equivalent snapshot shall be captured at startup and marked with its capture origin.
