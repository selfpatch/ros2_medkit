Standard Compliance
===================

This section tracks ros2_medkit's compliance with diagnostic industry standards.

.. note::

   These are **not project requirements** in the traditional V-Model sense.

   The items listed here represent standard API endpoints that ros2_medkit
   implements for interoperability with diagnostic tools and systems.
   The project may also include **extensions beyond the standard**
   (e.g., exposing ROS 2 Topics as diagnostic entities) which are documented
   separately.
