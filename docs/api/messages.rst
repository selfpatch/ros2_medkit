Fault.msg
~~~~~~~~~

Core fault data model representing an aggregated fault condition.

.. code-block:: text

   # Global fault identifier (e.g., "MOTOR_OVERHEAT", "SENSOR_FAILURE_001")
   string fault_code

   # Fault severity level (use SEVERITY_* constants)
   uint8 severity

   # Human-readable description of the fault condition
   string description

   # Timestamp when the current occurrence started (reset when a FAILED event
   # reactivates a CLEARED fault, so it moves with occurrence_count instead of
   # marking the fault's first report ever)
   builtin_interfaces/Time first_occurred

   # Timestamp when this fault last occurred (FAILED events only; a PASSED
   # event is the fault ending, not occurring, and does not touch this field)
   builtin_interfaces/Time last_occurred

   # Timestamp of the last PASSED event reported for this fault (zero = never)
   builtin_interfaces/Time last_passed

   # Number of times this fault has occurred, counted on edges: one for the first
   # FAILED event, and one more each time a FAILED event arrives while the fault is
   # CLEARED. Repeated FAILED events within one occurrence do not increment it;
   # last_occurred is what advances on those.
   uint32 occurrence_count

   # Current fault status (PREFAILED, PREPASSED, CONFIRMED, HEALED, CLEARED)
   string status

   # List of source identifiers that have reported this fault
   string[] reporting_sources

**Severity Constants:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 10 65

   * - Constant
     - Value
     - Description
   * - ``SEVERITY_INFO``
     - 0
     - Informational message, no action required
   * - ``SEVERITY_WARN``

     - 2
     - Error, impacts functionality
   * - ``SEVERITY_CRITICAL``
     - 3
     - Critical error, requires immediate attention. Bypasses debounce.

**Status Constants:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Status
     - Description
   * - ``PREFAILED``
     - Debounce counter < 0 but above threshold. Fault detected but not confirmed.
   * - ``PREPASSED``
     - Debounce counter > 0 but below threshold. Trending towards resolution.
   * - ``CONFIRMED``
     - Debounce counter <= confirmation threshold. Fault active and verified.
   * - ``HEALED``
     - Debounce counter >= healing threshold. Resolved by PASSED events.
   * - ``CLEARED``
     - Manually acknowledged via ClearFault service.

**Debounce Lifecycle:**

.. code-block:: text

   PREFAILED ←────────────────→ PREPASSED
       │      (counter crosses 0)    │
       ▼                             ▼
   CONFIRMED                      HEALED
       │                          (retained)
       ▼
   CLEARED (manual)

FaultEvent.msg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Real-time fault event notifications published on ``/fault_manager/events`` by default.
When the fault manager runs under an additional namespace, the topic follows the same
prefix (for example ``/robot1/fault_manager/events``).

.. code-block:: text

   # Event type (fault_confirmed, fault_cleared, fault_updated)
   string event_type

   # The fault data (current state after the event)
   Fault fault

   # Timestamp when this event was generated
   builtin_interfaces/Time timestamp

   # Symptom codes auto-cleared with root cause (correlation feature)
   string[] auto_cleared_codes

**Event Types:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Event
     - Description
   * - ``fault_confirmed``
     - Fault transitioned from PREFAILED to CONFIRMED
   * - ``fault_cleared``
     - Fault ended: cleared via the ClearFault service, or healed when PASSED
       events crossed the healing threshold (``fault.status`` distinguishes
       ``CLEARED`` from ``HEALED``)
   * - ``fault_updated``
     - Fault data changed without status transition (e.g., new occurrence)

MutedFaultInfo.msg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information about correlated (muted) symptom faults.

.. code-block:: text

   string fault_code       # The muted symptom's fault code
   string root_cause_code  # Root cause that triggered muting
   string rule_id          # Correlation rule ID that matched
   uint32 delay_ms         # Time delay from root cause [ms]

ClusterInfo.msg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Auto-detected fault cluster information.

.. code-block:: text

   string cluster_id              # Unique cluster ID
   string rule_id                 # Correlation rule ID
   string rule_name               # Human-readable rule name
   string label                   # Cluster label (e.g., "Communication Storm")
   string representative_code     # Primary fault code for display
   string representative_severity # Severity of representative fault
   string[] fault_codes           # All fault codes in cluster
   uint32 count                   # Number of faults
   builtin_interfaces/Time first_at  # First fault timestamp
   builtin_interfaces/Time last_at   # Last fault timestamp

Services
--------

ReportFault.srv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Report a fault event to the FaultManager.

**Request:**

.. code-block:: text

   string fault_code   # Global fault identifier (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
   uint8 event_type    # EVENT_FAILED (0) or EVENT_PASSED (1)
   uint8 severity      # Fault.SEVERITY_* constant (for FAILED events)
   string description  # Human-readable description
   string source_id    # Fully qualified node name (e.g., "/powertrain/temp_sensor")

**Response:**

.. code-block:: text

   bool accepted       # True if event was accepted

**Example Usage:**

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "ros2_medkit_msgs/srv/report_fault.hpp"

   auto request = std::make_shared<ros2_medkit_msgs::srv::ReportFault::Request>();
   request->fault_code = "MOTOR_OVERHEAT";
   request->event_type = ros2_medkit_msgs::srv::ReportFault::Request::EVENT_FAILED;
   request->severity = ros2_medkit_msgs::msg::Fault::SEVERITY_ERROR;
   request->description = "Motor temperature exceeded 85°C";
   request->source_id = get_fully_qualified_name();

   auto result = client->async_send_request(request);

ClearFault.srv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clear/acknowledge a fault.

**Request:**

.. code-block:: text

   string fault_code                # Fault code to clear
   bool   skip_correlation_auto_clear  # Opt out of correlation cascade clear

**Response:**

.. code-block:: text

   bool success            # True if fault was found and cleared
   string message          # Status message or error description
   string[] auto_cleared_codes  # Symptoms auto-cleared with root cause

When ``skip_correlation_auto_clear`` is ``false`` (default), clearing a
root-cause fault also clears every symptom that the correlation engine
attributes to it via ``auto_clear_with_root`` rules; the cleared
symptom codes are returned in ``auto_cleared_codes``. When ``true``,
only the requested ``fault_code`` is cleared and ``auto_cleared_codes``
is empty. The gateway's per-entity ``DELETE
/{entity-path}/faults/{fault_code}`` route sets this to ``true`` so
that an operator with access to one entity cannot cascade-clear
correlated symptoms reported by apps in other entities. The global
``DELETE /api/v1/faults/{fault_code}`` route leaves it ``false`` so
cluster-wide clearing still works.

.. note::

   Added in ``ros2_medkit_msgs`` post-0.4.0. Adding a request field
   changes the service type hash, so out-of-tree callers that invoke
   ``/fault_manager/clear_fault`` directly via ``ros2 service call`` or
   a generated client must rebuild against the new ``ros2_medkit_msgs``
   release to keep talking to ``fault_manager``.

ListFaults.srv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query faults from the FaultManager with optional filtering.

**Request:**

.. code-block:: text

   bool filter_by_severity   # Whether to filter by severity
   uint8 severity            # Severity to filter by (if filter_by_severity=true)
   string[] statuses         # Status filter (empty = CONFIRMED only)
   bool include_muted        # Include correlated symptoms
   bool include_clusters     # Include cluster information

**Response:**

.. code-block:: text

   Fault[] faults             # Matching faults
   uint32 muted_count         # Total muted faults
   MutedFaultInfo[] muted_faults  # Muted fault details (if requested)
   uint32 cluster_count       # Total clusters
   ClusterInfo[] clusters     # Cluster details (if requested)

**Example: Query all confirmed and pre-failed faults:**

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto request = std::make_shared<ros2_medkit_msgs::srv::ListFaults::Request>();
   request->filter_by_severity = false;
   request->statuses = {"CONFIRMED", "PREFAILED"};

   auto result = client->async_send_request(request);

GetSnapshots.srv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve diagnostic snapshots captured at fault occurrence time.

See :doc:`/tutorials/snapshots` for detailed usage.

SetPlannedStop.srv / GetPlannedStop.srv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Declare, withdraw and read a planned stop on the fault manager.

.. code-block:: text

   # SetPlannedStop.srv
   bool active          # true declares a planned stop, false withdraws it
   string reason        # why the plant is stopped
   string declared_by   # who declared the transition
   ---
   bool success         # true when the request was applied
   string message       # status or error description
   bool was_active      # the state of the switch before this request

   # GetPlannedStop.srv
   ---
   bool active                       # whether a planned stop is declared
   string reason                     # the reason given; retained after the withdrawal
   string declared_by                # who declared it; retained after the withdrawal
   builtin_interfaces/Time since     # when it was declared
   builtin_interfaces/Time ended_at  # when it was withdrawn; zero while one is in force

While a planned stop is on, it owns every fault cycle that *starts* - a new fault,
one raised again after being cleared, or one that fails again after healing. An
owned fault is reported, debounced, confirmed, captured and audited unchanged, and
is marked as muted: absent from the default ``ListFaults`` response, counted in
``muted_count``, and listed under ``muted_faults`` with ``rule_id: planned_stop``
when ``include_muted`` is set. A cycle that started before the stop is untouched.

Publication matches a rule-muted symptom exactly: ``EVENT_CONFIRMED`` and
``EVENT_UPDATED`` are withheld whichever kind of report produced them,
``EVENT_CLEARED`` is published as usual.

Withdrawing the stop does two things that do not cover the same faults. It *unmutes*
every fault it owns whose entry is the stop's own - a fault a hierarchical rule has
since claimed stays muted, and returns to the stop's mute if that rule's root cause
is acknowledged while the stop is still on. It *announces* the subset of those that
is CONFIRMED and that no live cluster is hiding, one ``EVENT_CONFIRMED`` each.

An auto-cluster rule hides a non-representative member without an entry of its own -
it suppresses that member's events on each report - so such a member is unmuted and
NOT announced, with nothing written in the stop's place. Afterwards the burst matches
one that never met a planned stop in ``muted_faults``, in the counts, in the cluster
listing and in the audit log, but not in the event stream: a confirmation that fell
inside the stop and behind a cluster is never announced. What is announced is the
representative, when the stop owned its cycle. A cluster hides only the reports that
fall inside its ``window_ms``; one after that starts a new burst, and the fault is
announced at the switch-off like any owned fault. Cluster membership is not
persisted, so a stop that spanned a restart releases every fault the store says it
owns and announces the CONFIRMED ones among them. The audit records exist only when
``audit_log.enabled`` is set, which it is not by default.

See :doc:`/config/fault-manager` for the configuration that decides whether the
declaration survives a restart and whether the transitions are audited.

MedkitDiscoveryHint.msg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Push-based entity enrichment hints published by ROS 2 nodes to the gateway
via the ``/ros2_medkit/discovery`` topic. The topic beacon plugin
(``ros2_medkit_topic_beacon``) subscribes to this topic and enriches the
discovery merge pipeline with the received metadata.

.. code-block:: text

   # Required
   string entity_id                        # Target entity (App or Component ID)

   # Identity hints
   string stable_id                        # Stable ID alias (x-medkit-stable-id metadata)
   string display_name                     # Human-friendly display name

   # Topology hints
   string[] function_ids                   # Function membership (entity belongs to these Functions)
   string[] depends_on                     # IDs of entities this entity depends on
   string component_id                     # Parent Component binding

   # Transport hints
   string transport_type                   # "nitros_zero_copy", "shared_memory", "intra_process"
   string negotiated_format               # "nitros_image_bgr8", etc.

   # Process diagnostics
   uint32 process_id                       # OS process ID (PID), 0 = not provided
   string process_name                     # Process name (e.g. "component_container")
   string hostname                         # Host identifier (for distributed systems)

   # Freeform metadata
   diagnostic_msgs/KeyValue[] metadata    # Arbitrary key-value pairs

   # Timing
   builtin_interfaces/Time stamp           # Timestamp for TTL calculation

All fields except ``entity_id`` are optional. Empty strings and empty arrays
mean "not provided" and are ignored by the plugin.

The same field semantics apply to ``ParameterBeaconPlugin`` via node
parameters. See :doc:`/config/discovery-options` for parameter naming.

The ``stamp`` field is used by the beacon TTL lifecycle:

- **ACTIVE** - hint is within the configured TTL (enrichment applied)
- **STALE** - hint is past TTL but within expiry (diagnostic data preserved,
  enrichment still applied with stale flag)
- **EXPIRED** - hint is past expiry (removed from enrichment)

**Example publisher (C++):**

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "ros2_medkit_msgs/msg/medkit_discovery_hint.hpp"

   auto pub = node->create_publisher<ros2_medkit_msgs::msg::MedkitDiscoveryHint>(
     "/ros2_medkit/discovery", 10);

   ros2_medkit_msgs::msg::MedkitDiscoveryHint hint;
   hint.entity_id = "my_sensor_node";
   hint.display_name = "Temperature Sensor";
   hint.function_ids = {"thermal_monitoring"};
   hint.process_id = getpid();
   hint.stamp = node->now();
   pub->publish(hint);
