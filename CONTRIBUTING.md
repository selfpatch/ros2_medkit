# Contributing to ros2_medkit

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ros2_medkit! This guide explains how to report issues, suggest features, and contribute code.

## How to Report Issues

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching [Issues](https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues)
- If you can't find an existing issue, [open a new one](https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/new/choose) and select the **Bug report** template
- Fill in all sections of the template:
  - **Steps to reproduce** - numbered steps to recreate the issue
  - **Expected behavior** - what you expected to happen
  - **Actual behavior** - what actually happened, including error messages or stack traces
  - **Environment** - ros2_medkit version, ROS 2 distro, OS
  - **Additional information** - logs, snippets, or screenshots if helpful

### Do you want to suggest a feature or improvement?

- Check if the feature has already been suggested in [Issues](https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues)
- If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/new/choose) and select the **Feature request / General issue** template
- Fill in all sections:
  - **Proposal** - describe the change or feature you'd like to see
  - **Motivation** - why is this important? Who does it benefit?
  - **Alternatives considered** - other options or implementations you considered
  - **Additional context** - any other context or screenshots

## How to Contribute Code

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally
2. **Install pre-commit hooks** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   - `feature/short-description` for new features
   - `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/short-description` for documentation changes
4. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards
5. **Test your changes** locally (see Build and Test section below)
6. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Pre-commit hooks will automatically check formatting
7. **Push your branch** to your fork
8. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of this repository

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a blank line followed by a more detailed explanation if needed

Examples:
```
Add support for SOVD entity mapping

Fix memory leak in diagnostic tree traversal

Update documentation for colcon build process
```

### Build and Test

Before opening or updating a Pull Request, you **must** build and test locally:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash   # or humble - adjust for your distro
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
```

Use `scripts/test.sh` for testing (preferred over raw colcon commands):

```bash
./scripts/test.sh              # Unit tests only (default)
./scripts/test.sh integ        # Integration tests only
./scripts/test.sh lint         # Fast linters (no clang-tidy)
./scripts/test.sh all          # Everything
./scripts/test.sh <test_name>  # Single test by CTest name regex
```

#### Pre-commit and Pre-push Hooks

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

On commit: clang-format, cmake-lint, shellcheck, flake8, ament-copyright, trailing whitespace.
On push: incremental clang-tidy on changed `.cpp` files.

#### Code Coverage

```bash
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
./scripts/test.sh              # run tests
lcov --capture --directory build --output-file coverage.raw.info --ignore-errors mismatch,negative
lcov --extract coverage.raw.info '*/ros2_medkit/src/*/src/*' '*/ros2_medkit/src/*/include/*' --output-file coverage.info
genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage_html
```

Open `coverage_html/index.html` in your browser.

#### CI/CD

All PRs are tested on Ubuntu 24.04 (Jazzy) with parallel lint + test jobs, plus Humble and Rolling (allowed to fail). Coverage is uploaded to Codecov on push to main. All CI jobs use ccache.

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the repository's style and conventions
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] New tests are added for new functionality
- [ ] Existing tests are updated if behavior changes
- [ ] Documentation is updated where applicable
- [ ] PR description clearly explains what changed and why
- [ ] Related issue is referenced (e.g., "Fixes #123")

### Code Review Process

- The project maintainers will review pull requests as time permits
- Address review feedback promptly
- Keep discussions professional and constructive
- Be patient - maintainers may need time to review

## What NOT to Contribute

- **Purely cosmetic changes** that don't add functionality (whitespace, formatting without other changes)
- **Large refactors** without prior discussion - open an issue first
- **Breaking changes** without coordination with maintainers
- **Code that doesn't pass tests** or breaks existing functionality
