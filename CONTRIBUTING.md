## How to Contribute Code

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally
2. **Install pre-commit hooks** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   - `feature/short-description` for new features
   - `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/short-description` for documentation changes
4. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards
5. **Test your changes** locally (see Build and Test section below)
6. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Pre-commit hooks will automatically check formatting
7. **Push your branch** to your fork
8. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of this repository

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a blank line followed by a more detailed explanation if needed

Examples:
```
Add support for SOVD entity mapping

Fix memory leak in diagnostic tree traversal

Update documentation for colcon build process
```

### Build and Test

Before opening or updating a Pull Request, you **must** build and test locally:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash   # or humble - adjust for your distro
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
```

Use `scripts/test.sh` for testing (preferred over raw colcon commands):

```bash
./scripts/test.sh              # Unit tests only (default)
./scripts/test.sh integ        # Integration tests only
./scripts/test.sh lint         # Fast linters (no clang-tidy)
./scripts/test.sh all          # Everything
./scripts/test.sh <test_name>  # Single test by CTest name regex
```

#### Pre-commit and Pre-push Hooks

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

On commit: clang-format, cmake-lint, shellcheck, flake8, ament-copyright, trailing whitespace.
On push: incremental clang-tidy on changed `.cpp` files.

#### Reproducing a sanitizer failure locally

The ASan/TSan jobs multiply every declared CTest `TIMEOUT` by three, but a
budget a test asserts on *itself* is invisible to that rewrite - an
instrumented gateway can blow a "must answer within N seconds" assertion long
before ctest's clock runs out, and the failure then reads as a product
regression rather than as instrumentation overhead. Those budgets read
`MEDKIT_TEST_TIME_SCALE`, which the sanitizer jobs export with the same factor.

Set it when reproducing a sanitizer failure locally, or the run you get is not
the run CI got:

```bash
MEDKIT_TEST_TIME_SCALE=3 colcon test --ctest-args -LE linter
```

It is honoured by both suites - Python integration tests via
`ros2_medkit_test_utils.constants.get_time_scale()`, and C++ fixtures that wait
on wall-clock budgets via their own local `test_time_scale()` helper. Unset,
unparseable or below `1` means no scaling, so ordinary runs keep the tight
budgets that give the assertions their falsifying power.

#### Code Coverage

Run from the workspace root. This mirrors the measurement pipeline of the CI
coverage job (same lcov capture, filters and flags), so the local percentage is
comparable to the published one. The job additionally builds with
`--symlink-install`, installs `ros-jazzy-test-msgs` via rosdep, and prints
`lcov --list`; see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the authoritative version.

```bash
WS="${PWD}"   # gcov records the path the compiler was given, not the resolved one

colcon build --packages-skip ros2_medkit_opcua \
  --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
colcon test --packages-skip ros2_medkit_opcua --ctest-args -LE linter

lcov --capture --directory build --output-file coverage.raw.info \
  --ignore-errors mismatch,negative,empty,gcov
lcov --extract coverage.raw.info "${WS}/src/*/src/*" "${WS}/src/*/include/*" \
  --output-file coverage.extracted.info --ignore-errors unused,empty
lcov --remove coverage.extracted.info '*/vendored/*' \
  --output-file coverage.info --ignore-errors unused,empty
genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage_html --ignore-errors source

./scripts/check_coverage_packages.sh coverage.info --skip ros2_medkit_opcua
```

Open `coverage_html/index.html` in your browser.

`ros2_medkit_opcua` is skipped because it pulls `open62541pp` over the network
via `FetchContent`, which costs every matrix run time for a plugin unrelated to
it; CI skips it in the same jobs and builds it separately in
`.github/workflows/opcua-plugin.yml`. Dropping the `--remove` step leaves
vendored third-party code in the report and your number will not match CI's.

#### Coverage scope

`ENABLE_COVERAGE` is handled by the shared `ROS2MedkitCoverage` module, not by
per-package CMake code. **Every package that compiles production C++ must
`include(ROS2MedkitCoverage)` before it declares its first target** - the flags
apply at directory scope, so a target created before the include is not
instrumented. Packages that compile only test scaffolding are exempt and are
listed in `EXCLUDED_PACKAGES` in the gate script, each with a reason;
`ros2_medkit_integration_tests` is the current entry.

A package that misses this does not fail the build. It emits no `.gcda`, lcov
never sees it, and it drops out of both the numerator and the denominator - the
reported percentage then silently describes a subset of the workspace.

`scripts/check_coverage_packages.sh` guards against that. It derives the set of
packages that *must* appear from the source tree (anything holding hand-written
C++ under `src/` or `include/`), never from the presence of the include - a set
derived from the include could not detect a package that never added it, or one
where the line was deleted. It runs twice in CI: `--static-only` in the Quality
workflow, so a missing include fails in seconds, and against the real report in
the coverage job. Pass `--skip <package>` for a package the current job does not
build.

#### CI/CD

All PRs are tested on Ubuntu 24.04 (Jazzy), where build and tests run in a single job, plus Humble and Lyrical. Linters and clang-tidy run in the Quality workflow. Coverage is uploaded to Codecov on push to main. ccache is configured in the CI and Quality workflows and in the OPC-UA workflow's colcon jobs. The Pixi workflow and the Docker image builds compile the workspace without it, so a slow build there is expected rather than a cache problem.

Every ccache-backed build step ends with `scripts/ccache_report.sh`, which writes the hit rate, cache size and cleanup count to the job summary. It raises a workflow warning in the two states that make a cache useless: cleanups above zero, meaning the cache evicted objects the same build was still producing and `CCACHE_MAXSIZE` is too small for it, and a hit rate under 50% with no cleanups, meaning the cache was never restored and the key or its `restore-keys` prefix is wrong. It never fails the step - a cold cache is a legitimate state.
