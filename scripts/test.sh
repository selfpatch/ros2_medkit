# Quick-test presets for ros2_medkit development.
# Usage: ./scripts/test.sh [preset] [extra colcon test args...]
#
# Presets:
#   unit        - Unit tests only, no linters, no integration (DEFAULT)
#   integ       - Integration tests only
#   lint        - Linters only (clang-format, copyright, cmake-lint; NO clang-tidy)
#   tidy        - clang-tidy only (slow; accepts --jobs N, see below)
#   all         - Everything (equivalent to bare colcon test)
#   <test_name> - Run a single test by CTest name regex
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/test.sh                        # unit tests only
#   ./scripts/test.sh integ                  # integration tests only
#   ./scripts/test.sh lint                   # fast linters only
#   ./scripts/test.sh test_health_handler    # single test
#   ./scripts/test.sh unit --packages-select ros2_medkit_gateway
#   ./scripts/test.sh tidy --jobs 8          # trade memory for speed
#
# The tidy preset defaults to a small number of clang-tidy processes per package
# so one package fits an 8 GB machine. Each process peaks around 1.4 GiB, so
# --jobs N costs roughly N x 1.4 GiB. The value sticks in the CMake cache and is
# printed on every run.

# `colcon test-result` at the end reports on whatever it finds under build/, and it
# reads BOTH the ament xunit files and CTest's own Testing/<timestamp>/Test.xml
# directories. A run that tests one package therefore reports the tallies of every
# package tested since the last clean, and a preset that selects a handful of tests
# still prints a total in the thousands. Deleting only the xunit files is not enough:
# the CTest directories alone are enough to produce a total with no file on disk to
# back it, which reads as a passing suite that never ran.
