"""End-to-end specification for relaying from a peer that requires auth.

An aggregator holds ONE stream per peer, opened when the first local client
attaches and shared by every client after it, so it has no client whose token
it could carry. Against a peer that authenticates its reads it was therefore
refused, and the aggregator's own stream went on answering 200 while carrying
local events only - the same open, valid, empty stream this whole change set
exists to remove, one layer further out.

``aggregation.peer_auth_header`` is what the gateway presents on connections it
opens on its OWN behalf. This test drives the whole path a value in that key
travels: parameter -> AggregationConfig -> PeerClient health check ->
healthy_peer_endpoints -> RelayTarget -> the peer's /faults/stream.

THE RULES

C1  An aggregator holding the credential relays a fault raised on the
    authenticating peer, and says which peer it came from.
C2  An aggregator with no credential relays NOTHING from that peer. This is the
    control: without it C1 would pass just as well against a peer that never
    checked the Authorization header at all, and would prove nothing about the
    credential.
C3  The peer records the aggregator as online only where the credential is
    configured. The health check is the first thing that would 401, and a peer
    reported as down never reaches the relay at all - so this pins WHERE the
    credential is needed, not just that the relay ends up working.
