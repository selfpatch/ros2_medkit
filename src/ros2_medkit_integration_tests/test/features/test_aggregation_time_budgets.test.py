"""End-to-end specification for an aggregating gateway's time budgets.

A peer forward carries the peer's own work: a synchronous service call runs
against THAT gateway's ``service_call_timeout_sec``, and a large
resource has to be serialised and transferred on top. One budget covering both
that and a metadata read gives the forward the budget of a listing, and the
answer a client gets is that the peer is unavailable - at the moment that peer
is serving the same request.

THE RULES

B1  An operation that takes longer than the metadata budget and less than the
    forward budget returns the peer's own result. Asserting a 200 alone would
    not show this: a fast operation returns 200 whatever the budgets are, so
    the call has to be held open past the metadata budget on purpose and the
    elapsed time asserted.
B2  A large resource arrives whole. Proven by comparing the array length
    against a read taken straight from the owning gateway, not by status. This
    rule is about completeness only: how long a given machine takes to
    serialise 180000 readings is a property of the machine, so requiring a
    timeout here would measure the host rather than the gateway.
B3  An operation against an aggregator whose forward budget is BELOW the work
    answers 504 not-responding. This is what makes B1 mean something: a test
    that passes under every budget is not measuring a budget. The two
    aggregators differ in exactly the key under test, and the peer is held for
    a controlled four seconds so the answer cannot depend on host speed.
B4  A timeout is not an unavailable peer. 504 ``not-responding`` and 502
    ``x-medkit-peer-unavailable`` are different answers to different events,
    and the timeout names the budget it exceeded so an operator can act on it.
