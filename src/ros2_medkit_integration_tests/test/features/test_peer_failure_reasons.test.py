"""End-to-end specification for why a peer dropped out of a fanned-out answer.

A fanned-out collection whose peer failed answers 200 with ``x-medkit.partial``
and ``failed_peers``. Those name WHICH peer contributed nothing and nothing
more, so a peer that ran out of time, one that answered an error status and one
that is not there any more are the same entry - and a client cannot tell a busy
subsystem from a dead one, which is the only question a partial answer raises.

THE RULES

R1  A peer slower than the aggregator's metadata budget is reported as
    ``timeout``.
R2  The SAME request, against the SAME peer, from an aggregator whose budget
    outlasts the peer's own answer, is reported as ``error-status``. This is
    the pair that matters: two aggregators, one peer, one request, two reasons.
    A classifier that returned one constant would pass R1 alone.
R3  A peer that is gone is reported as ``unreachable``, never as ``timeout``.
    The two point an operator at different boxes.
R4  ``failed_peers`` keeps its shape. Every deployed client reads a list of
    names there, and the reasons arrive beside it rather than in place of it.

NOT COVERED HERE, and why. ``too-large``, ``invalid-response`` and ``canceled``
are classified in the same table but are not reachable through a healthy
ros2_medkit peer over the contract: the first needs a peer serving a body past
the 10 MB cap on a LIST route, which no list produces; the second needs a peer
answering non-JSON on a JSON route; the third is this gateway's own shutdown.
They are stated as unreachable rather than left looking untested.
