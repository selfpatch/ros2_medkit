"""End-to-end specification for /faults/stream on an aggregating gateway.

An aggregator runs on its own ROS domain, with its own fault_manager that no
producer reports to. A stream fed from that graph alone is open, valid, and
sends nothing but keepalives - and a client reading it reports the system as
healthy while its peers are on fire. In a deployment where the aggregator is
the only port an operator can reach, that is the only fault stream there is.

THE RULES

S1  A fault raised on a peer reaches a client attached to the AGGREGATOR's
    stream, and says which peer it came from. Asserting "some event arrived"
    would not show this: the aggregator has a fault_manager of its own, so an
    event with no attribution proves nothing about where it was raised.
S2  The peer's own stream still carries it. The relay is an addition, not a
    redirection.
S3  The relay costs a peer SSE client slot only while somebody is listening.
    Measured on the PEER's own occupancy (``x-medkit-sse`` on its ``/health``),
    because the claim is about a connection the peer is holding and only the
    peer can answer that. A count of calls made from here would say nothing.
    ``sse.max_clients`` defaults to 2, so an aggregator holding one at rest is
    an outage waiting for the second operator.
S4  A stream request carrying X-Medkit-No-Fan-Out is served from the local
    graph only. That header is what an aggregating peer sends when it relays,
    and without it a chain of them would carry one event round the loop for
    ever.
