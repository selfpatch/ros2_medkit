Integration test: `unmanifested_nodes: ignore` must not delete plugin entities.

The orphan sweep used to decide protection by matching an entity's
``x-medkit.source`` against a list of known strings. That string is chosen by
whoever produced the entity: a discovery plugin may set anything, and the
beacon mapper sets ``beacon``. A provider that picked a tag the list had never
heard of therefore had its entities swept away - and this branch is what makes
``ignore`` actually take effect, so the sweep is newly reachable.

Protection now follows the layer that OWNS the entity, which the pipeline knows
for certain, rather than a string carried in the data. This test pins that end
to end with the in-tree test plugin, which declares two apps:

* ``plugin_dev`` - ``source: "plugin"``, a tag the old whitelist knew
* ``plugin_unlisted_source`` - ``source: "beacon"``, a tag it did not

Both must survive. The second is the one that regressed; the first is here so a
failure tells you whether protection broke generally or only for unlisted tags.
