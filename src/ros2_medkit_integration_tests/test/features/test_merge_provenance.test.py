Integration tests: a manifest entity keeps its provenance under every layer policy.

``x-medkit.source`` is provenance, and the merge pipeline's orphan and
deduplication filters key their delete decision on it: a manifest-sourced
entity is protected, a runtime-sourced one is not. A field-group policy must
therefore never be able to rewrite it.

Three gateways run side by side on one ROS graph against the same entity
declarations, differing only in how the manifest layer's METADATA policy ends
up configured:

====================  ==============================================  ==============
Gateway               Configuration                                   Manifest layer
====================  ==============================================  ==============
default               shipped defaults                                authoritative
no-override           manifest ``config: allow_manifest_override:      fallback
                      false``
metadata-fallback     gateway param                                    fallback
                      ``...layers.manifest.metadata: fallback``
====================  ==============================================  ==============

The two demoting gateways are the two doors onto the same code path. All three
must serve the same answer.

**The app under test is deliberately named after its node.** ``temp_sensor``
binds to the node ``temp_sensor``, so the manifest layer and the runtime layer
contribute an entity under the *same* id and the per-field-group merge actually
runs. ``mp-pressure`` binds to ``pressure_sensor`` under a different id and is
the control: no merge, so it was never at risk.

**Why this test polls instead of checking once.** The failure it guards is not
a clean, stable deletion - the entity can come and go between discovery passes,
and the collection listing and the detail endpoint can contradict each other at
the same instant. A single sample passes even against the broken gateway. So
every sample is asserted, and the two views are compared against each other,
not just against the expectation.

**How the test knows discovery really kept running.** Elapsed wall time proves
nothing: a gateway whose refresh timer died after its first pass would still
sit there answering, and a sleep-based test would call that twelve passes. The
gateway does publish a real counter - ``x-medkit-entity-cache.generation`` -
but it is deliberately gated on the cache CONTENTS changing, so on a steady
graph it never moves however many passes run (measured: flat across eight
samples spanning ten passes). So the window is given something to notice: an
undeclared node joins part-way through, and sampling continues until every
gateway's generation has advanced past the value it had before. That advance is
the proof the pipeline was alive during the window; it cannot be produced by a
stopped timer.
