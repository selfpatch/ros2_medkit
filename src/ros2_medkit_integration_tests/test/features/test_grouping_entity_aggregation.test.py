"""
End-to-end specification for one resource-addressing model across any entity.

An AGGREGATING entity draws its resources from members rather than owning them:
an Area, a Function (cross-component and cross-area by definition), or a
Component with subcomponents - and a subcomponent can live on its own gateway,
so a parent on the host with a child on another ECU is a normal deployment.

The model has two halves and they have to be built in this order.

IDENTITY FIRST. An item can only be addressed back to whatever serves it if
that thing has a name that is unique in the merged tree. Today Apps are
renamed on collision (`<peer>__<id>`) but Components are not - two peers
announcing one Component id resolve last-writer-wins - and member ids arriving
from a peer are re-emitted verbatim, so they can name something the aggregator
does not have. Until leaf identity is unique, no addressing scheme works,
because the qualifier itself is ambiguous.

ADDRESSING SECOND, and it has exactly two cases, decided per collection rather
than per handler:

  a LEAF-OWNED item  - a topic, an operation, a configuration key, a fault
                       record - belongs to one leaf, and is addressed
                       "<leaf>:<item>". A fault record is (fault_code,
                       reporting source), and the source is the leaf.
  an AGGREGATE item  - one a grouping computes over its members rather than
                       holds - belongs to the aggregate itself, and is
                       addressed by its own id while naming its contributors.

Logs and bulk-data are not exceptions to the model. Which case a collection is,
is declared once.

WHAT THIS SUITE EXISTS TO PREVENT, all three measured on this topology:

  * A grouping lists an item, then answers a read of it from the LOCAL graph
    only. An unknown topic returns 200 with status "metadata_only", so the
    client is told the read succeeded and handed an empty body.
  * Two members exposing one operation short name: the list shows both, and
    execution resolves against the local cache alone.
  * The fan-out concatenates peer items with no key, so one id can appear twice
    with nothing on the wire telling the copies apart.

THE RULES

R1  A leaf contributed by more than one gateway is addressable as more than one
    entity. Identity is unique after the merge.
R2  Every listed item names the leaf or leaves that contribute it.
R3  A leaf-owned item provided by MORE THAN ONE leaf is addressed
    "<leaf>:<item>". An item with a single provider keeps its bare id.
    Qualification follows ambiguity, not aggregation: in runtime discovery every
    App hangs off the one host Component, so "aggregating" is the ordinary
    entity, and qualifying everything there would change the ids of the most
    used entity in the product and refuse requests every current client sends.
    Where ONE leaf provides two operations under one short name - the wire id
    is the last segment of the ROS path, so `left/calibrate` and
    `right/calibrate` are two operations called `calibrate` - the leaf half
    names that same leaf twice and separates nothing. Those take the ROS path,
    leading slash stripped, as their item half: "robot/left/calibrate" on the
    leaf itself and "<leaf>:robot/left/calibrate" on an aggregate.
R4  A bare id is refused only when it is ambiguous, and the refusal names the
    form to use. An unambiguous bare id keeps working.
R5  A compound id reaches its leaf, local or on a peer, and returns that leaf's
    data. Asserting the status alone cannot show this: the failure mode is a
    200 with an empty body.
R6  An item no leaf provides is refused, and is distinguishable from an item
    that exists and is empty.
R7  A Component both sides contribute to aggregates. Routing it wholesale to
    one peer would discard the other half, which is what happens today.
R8  A lock on a leaf is honoured by a request dispatched through an aggregate.
    Verified in test_aggregate_lock_identity, which needs a second gateway
    holding the lock and so cannot share this topology.
R9  Peered gateways terminate.
R10 A manifest-declared entity outlives the link that reported it: it stays in
    the tree, keeps the items it last reported, and says it cannot be reached.
    A runtime-discovered one vanishes, because it describes a graph this
    gateway can no longer observe. Availability belongs to what a request can
    be addressed to - an App or a Component. A grouping entity is a view over
    members and carries none of its own; a client asks the members.
