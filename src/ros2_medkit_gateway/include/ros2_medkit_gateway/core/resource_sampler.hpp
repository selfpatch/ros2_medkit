/// Thread-safe registry mapping collection names to sampling functions.

/// `get_sampler()` hands out the stored callable *by value* - callers (e.g.
/// `SubscriptionTransportProvider::start()`) keep their own copy for the
/// lifetime of a cyclic subscription, entirely independent of this registry.
/// A plugin's callable captures the plugin instance, so once the plugin is
/// torn down and `remove_sampler()` erases the registry entry, any copy
/// handed out *before* removal would otherwise still point at freed memory.
///
/// A liveness flag alone is not enough to close that gap: a caller could load
/// the flag as `true`, get preempted, and only then invoke the underlying
/// plugin callable - by which point `remove_sampler()` has already returned
/// and the caller that erased the entry (`PluginManager::disable_plugin`) may
/// have already freed the plugin object. Checking the flag and calling
/// through are two separate steps, and nothing serialized them against
/// removal.
///
/// To close that check-then-call race, every callable this registry hands
/// out (via `register_sampler`, and therefore via every `get_sampler` copy)
/// shares a `ControlBlock` containing both the liveness flag and a
/// `shared_mutex`. Invocation takes a `shared_lock` on that mutex for the
/// *entire* duration of the flag check plus the call into the underlying
/// callable - not just the flag check. `remove_sampler()` takes a
/// `unique_lock` on the same mutex before flipping the flag, which blocks
/// until every in-flight invocation (holding the `shared_lock`) has finished;
/// only then does it flip the flag and return. This means `remove_sampler()`
/// does not return until no call into the underlying (about-to-be-freed)
/// callable is in progress, closing the race a plain atomic flag could not.
///
/// The `ControlBlock` is shared - not owned - by the registry entry and by
/// every outstanding copy of the callable, via `shared_ptr`, so the drain
/// works even for copies that already escaped the registry (e.g. a running
/// cyclic subscription's transport) before removal. The registry's own
/// `mutex_` only ever protects `samplers_` itself (the map); it is
/// deliberately released before draining a specific entry's `ControlBlock`,
/// so a slow in-flight sampler call for one collection cannot block
/// unrelated registry operations (register/get/has_sampler for other
/// collections) for its duration.
