/**
 * @brief Zero-config freeze-frames for plugin-backed entities.
 *
 * Plugin entities (PLC apps bridged by protocol plugins) report faults under
 * their bare SOVD entity id, and their live values are not ROS topics - the
 * fault_manager's snapshot capture can never freeze-frame them. This class
 * closes that gap on the gateway side: it subscribes to fault_manager events
 * and, when a fault confirms with a plugin-owned reporting source, snapshots
 * that entity's current data values (DataProvider::list_data, which serves
 * from the plugin's latest polled values) at fault time.
 *
 * The frames are merged into the fault detail's environment_data.snapshots
 * only when the fault_manager captured no freeze-frame itself - a configured
 * freeze-frame always wins, while a rosbag-only capture does not suppress the
 * entity frames (see FaultHandlers::merge_entity_freeze_frames).
 *
 * Retention mirrors the fault_manager's freeze-frame semantics: frames are
 * kept across EVENT_CLEARED (the confirmed-state record stays attached to
 * the cleared fault's detail) and overwritten on every EVENT_CONFIRMED, so
 * a re-occurrence re-samples the plugin at its own confirm time.
