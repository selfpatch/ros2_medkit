/**
 * @brief Handler for Server-Sent Events (SSE) fault streaming.
 *
 * Provides real-time fault event notifications via SSE at:
 * - GET /faults/stream
 *
 * Events streamed:
 * - fault_confirmed: When a fault transitions to CONFIRMED status
 * - fault_cleared: When a fault ends (acknowledged clear, or auto-heal)
 * - fault_updated: When fault data changes (occurrence_count, sources)
 *
 * Features:
 * - Multi-client support (multiple browsers can connect simultaneously)
 * - Keepalive every 30 seconds to prevent connection timeout
 * - Automatic reconnection support via Last-Event-ID header (values above the
 *   newest issued id are clamped to it, so a bogus header cannot starve the
 *   stream or alias the delivery accounting)
 * - On an aggregating gateway, the peers' streams are relayed into this one.
 *   An aggregator runs on its own ROS domain with its own fault_manager that
 *   no producer reports to, so a stream fed from the local graph alone is open,
 *   valid and silent - which reads to a client exactly like a healthy system.
 *   Each relayed event carries the peer it came from in ``x-medkit.peer``.
 *   Replay is over this gateway's OWN ids: two peers number their events
 *   independently, so a `Last-Event-ID` cannot address a position in a merged
 *   stream, and a reconnecting client resumes from what this gateway has
 *   buffered rather than from each peer's own history.
 * - Replay buffer of up to 100 events. Eviction order under overflow:
 *   1. entries every live client has already been sent (free),
 *   2. fault_updated entries superseded by a newer event for the same fault
 *      record, the same code and owner (coalesced - a lagging client still
 *      converges on the correct current state, and no status transition is
 *      erased),
 *   3. transition entries (confirmed / cleared) superseded by a newer event
 *      for the same record - the current state survives but the transition
 *      history is lost, so this IS counted and logged as a drop,
 *   4. the oldest entry, owed and not superseded - counted and logged too.
