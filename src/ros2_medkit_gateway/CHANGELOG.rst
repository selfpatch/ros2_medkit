-----------
* Entity freeze-frames survive a restart when ``entity_freeze_frame.storage.path`` names a database. Without one the frames lived in process memory, so a restart threw them away and the startup catch-up re-read the plant as it is now, serving today's values under the original fault and marking them ``x-medkit.capture_origin: startup`` - the values at fault time, which are the point of a freeze-frame, were gone. A reloaded frame is served exactly as it was captured: its original ``captured_at``, its own ``capture_origin`` (absent on a confirm-edge frame), and the ``connected`` / ``source_timestamp`` provenance it carried, and the startup catch-up then re-reads only the faults that have no frame. Leaving the path empty puts the store in ``entity_freeze_frames.db`` next to ``triggers.storage.path``. With neither set the frames stay in memory as before, and a store that cannot be opened or written is reported while the capture keeps working. The retained-frame bound of 256 faults counts reloaded and freshly captured frames together, a frame whose fault the fault_manager no longer holds in any status is dropped at startup (one reported as cleared keeps its frame), and a frame belonging to an occurrence that has since been cleared and re-confirmed is re-read at startup and marked ``capture_origin: startup`` rather than served as the current one

0.7.0 (2026-08-27)
------------------
* Rosbag bulk-data is addressed by recording id instead of fault code, so a fault holding several recordings can expose each one. ``GET /{entity}/bulk-data/rosbags`` now emits one descriptor per recording rather than one per fault - a burst that shares a bag used to appear as several entries each reporting the full bag size - and the covered faults move into ``x-medkit.fault_codes`` (was the scalar ``x-medkit.fault_code``). Old URLs keep working: an id that is not a recording is resolved as a fault code and serves that fault's newest recording, which is what it returned before. Authorization is unchanged in effect - a download is allowed when any fault the recording covers is in the entity's source scope, which is exactly the set that could reach it previously (`#623 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/623>`_, `#620 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/620>`_)
* Manual asset inventory: a manifest ``assets:`` list and a new ``discovery.inventory.csv_path`` parameter declare assets that no protocol layer can describe (or fully describe). Both paths recognize the canonical names ``id, manufacturer, model, serial, hardware_rev, firmware, endpoint, role, area`` plus the shared aliases (``serial_number``, ``hardware_revision`` / ``hw_rev``, ``firmware_version`` / ``fw``) and keep any other column / key as an extra; RFC-4180-style quoting is honored. Each asset becomes a Component with ``source = "inventory"`` and a structured asset identity carrying per-field provenance, appended to the base manifest on every load / reload and merged into the tree by id alongside protocol-discovered structure; ``area`` places the asset under an Area, without it the asset appears only in the flat component list. CSV rows never fail the load: rows without an ``id`` are skipped with a warning, for duplicate ids the first row wins, a row whose id is already a manifest component keeps the manifest definition (the row's identity is folded in as gap-fill), and an unknown ``area`` is dropped with a warning. The CSV is size-capped at 1 MiB before being read; a missing file is skipped with a warning (mirrors ``fragments_dir``), while an unreadable or malformed one fails the load / reload. Requires a manifest-backed discovery mode (``manifest_only`` / ``hybrid`` with ``discovery.manifest_path`` set); empty = disabled (default) (`#493 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/493>`_, `#490 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/490>`_)
* **Breaking:** the lifecycle status ``operationId`` values were singularized - ``getAppStatus`` and ``putAppStatusRestart`` rather than the plural collection forms they were built from before - so a generated client gets renamed methods for those operations (`#497 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/497>`_)
* Aggregation now separates the time budget for reading metadata from the budget for real work. One ``aggregation.timeout_ms`` was applied as both the connect and the read timeout for every call, so a synchronous service call on a peer got two seconds end to end while the peer's own budget for the same call was ten; a large resource fanned out to a peer could not finish inside it either. The write timeout, which was never set and stayed at the cpp-httplib default, now follows the configured budget, and the timeout values are validated and reported rather than silently clamped (`#638 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/638>`_, `#528 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/528>`_)
* A request that ran out of time is reported as a timeout. A peer that did not answer in the budget returns ``504`` with ``ERR_NOT_RESPONDING`` instead of ``502`` claiming the peer is unavailable - which it did while that peer was answering the same request - a fanned-out collection carries the per-peer failure reason instead of only a boolean, and an operation that exceeds its own service-call budget says so rather than returning a generic failure (`#638 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/638>`_, `#612 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/612>`_)
* ``GET /faults/stream`` on an aggregating gateway relays its peers' fault events. It previously returned ``200`` with an open stream that only ever sent keepalive comments, which is indistinguishable from a healthy system - and on a deployment where the aggregator is the only reachable port, it was the only fault stream available (`#638 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/638>`_, `#611 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/611>`_)
* One addressing model for an aggregating entity's resources, so the aggregator no longer refuses or 404s work its peers can serve (`#626 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/626>`_, `#613 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/613>`_)
* Nested ``plugins.<name>.*`` parameters are rebuilt into a nested object instead of a flat dotted key, so nested plugin configuration reaches the plugin again (`#518 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/518>`_, `#520 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/520>`_)
* Discovery configuration is read from the documented top-level ``config:`` key. It was only ever read from ``discovery.config``, so the documented form was dropped without a word and unmanifested nodes leaked into the tree in hybrid mode (`#609 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/609>`_, `#529 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/529>`_)
* Every startup parameter that is coerced or refused is reported. A clamped thread count or keep-alive timeout used to change the value and log nothing, leaving the configuration file and the running process in silent disagreement. Integer parameters are read as the int64 a ROS parameter holds and validated before narrowing, so a value past ``INT_MAX`` can no longer wrap back into the legal band and pass its own range check, and range checks are written so that NaN is refused rather than accepted (`#607 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/607>`_, `#603 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/603>`_)
* ``server.executor_threads`` is real rather than advisory, and a cancel that runs out of time is reported as a timeout (`#593 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/593>`_)
* An unresponsive parameter node no longer hangs the REST API (`#532 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/532>`_), per-node parameter caches are bounded with LRU eviction (`#534 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/534>`_), the transport's node is released before the context dies (`#567 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/567>`_), and the parameter error surface is consistent between list and get, with a non-404 error winning over NOT_FOUND across nodes (`#540 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/540>`_, `#543 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/543>`_)
* Faults from plugin-provided entities are visible in the fault list, in fault detail and in freeze-frame through fault-scope ownership (`#503 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/503>`_), an external Component owns its fault-manager faults (`#530 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/530>`_), plugin-provided entities own their bulk data and logs (`#560 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/560>`_), and the external flag survives the hybrid merge (`#522 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/522>`_)
* Zero-config freeze-frame for plugin-backed entities: when a fault confirms with a plugin-owned reporting source, that entity's current data values are snapshotted with no configuration. Plugin entities report under their bare SOVD entity id and their values are not ROS topics, so the fault manager's own snapshot capture could never reach them. Gated on at least one plugin being loaded (`#538 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/538>`_), a fault already raised at gateway startup gets one (`#563 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/563>`_), and so does an entity serving last known values (`#565 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/565>`_)
* Data triggers work on plugin-provided entities, resolving from declared topics, and fail loudly on a topic name that cannot be resolved instead of silently never firing (`#592 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/592>`_). Trigger subscriptions go through the shared subscription executor (`#549 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/549>`_)
* Asset identity model with per-field provenance and merge-by-identity (`#488 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/488>`_)
* Build, image and test: an arm64 multi-arch image gated on tag or dispatch (`#508 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/508>`_), the fault bridges and ``ros2_medkit_fault_detection`` bundled into the image (`#470 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/470>`_, `#494 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/494>`_), coverage instrumentation for every C++ package (`#582 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/582>`_), and clang-tidy analysing a package's translation units in parallel, cutting PR feedback time from about 56 minutes to about 35 (`#588 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/588>`_, `#590 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/590>`_)
* Config-less fault triggers: a threshold rule declared at runtime raises a fault when a data value crosses it and clears the fault when the value comes back. Rules are managed on Apps over ``GET`` and ``POST`` ``/apps/{app_id}/fault-triggers`` and ``DELETE`` ``/apps/{app_id}/fault-triggers/{trigger_id}``, and survive a restart when ``fault_triggers.storage.path`` names a database. The engine needs at least one loaded plugin, so ``fault_triggers.enabled`` (default true) is necessary rather than sufficient; ``fault_triggers.poll_interval_ms`` (default 1000) is floored at 50 ms and a lower value is reported. This is a separate facility from the SOVD notification ``/triggers`` (`#544 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/544>`_)
* An aggregating gateway can authenticate to its peers. ``aggregation.peer_auth_header`` carries the credential this gateway presents on connections it opens on its own behalf - the peer health check, the entity fetch, the fault-stream relay, and any forward whose caller sent no credential to pass on. Where ``forward_auth`` is enabled and the caller did send one, that token wins, so the peer keeps being told the end user. The header is empty by default, and is deliberately withheld from peers found by mDNS discovery rather than configured explicitly. The value is redacted from the configurations API alongside ``auth.jwt_secret`` and ``auth.clients``, so reading configuration back cannot disclose it (`#638 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/638>`_)
* A secure-by-default field profile ships as ``gateway_params.secure.yaml``, together with a hardening checklist. It turns on JWT authentication, TLS, restricted CORS and rate limiting, so it needs certificates and credentials provisioned before use and is not a drop-in replacement for the default profile (`#485 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/485>`_)
* The fault SSE stream carries ``auto_cleared_codes``. A consumer can now see which correlated symptom faults were cleared along with their root cause, which previously happened without any event of their own (`#573 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/573>`_)
* **Breaking:** an action execution now belongs to the entity it was started on. Reading, stopping or cancelling an execution through a different entity returns ``404`` instead of being served, and an execution listing is filtered to the executions the addressed entity owns. An execution id used to work as a global handle (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* **Breaking:** ``GET <entity-path>/docs`` is readable by ``viewer`` rather than ``admin``. The permission table is now derived from the route registrations instead of a hand-maintained literal, and this route's derived pattern places it with the other read paths. Only reachable where ``auth.enabled`` is true (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* The OpenAPI document is derived from the code that serves the routes rather than declared beside it: the success status and its schema come from the handler's return type, the ``Location`` header follows from that status, a feature gate declares the ``501`` it returns, the lock contract and the RBAC permission table are read out of the registrations, and each ``<entity-path>/docs`` sub-document is a projection of the paths that path actually serves. The rule and what is deliberately still declared by hand are written down in ``design/openapi_derivation.rst`` (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_, `#583 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/583>`_)
* A build with ``BUILD_TESTING=ON`` records every status the gateway puts on the wire, and an integration sweep driven from the served document asserts that each one is declared. The sweep refuses to pass vacuously: operations it could not reach must match a declared list, and it requires a minimum spread of error sites. The recorder is compiled out of the published image (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* Statuses a caller receives, corrected: a configuration value that cannot be converted to the parameter's ROS type answers ``400`` rather than ``500``; a fault manager that refuses a fault lookup or clear answers ``404``, with ``503`` reserved for a transport that gave no answer at all; a ``config_id`` past the published bound answers ``400`` on ``DELETE`` as it already did on the other verbs; and an operation-execution listing resolves on Areas and Functions instead of reporting ``404`` (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* ``POST`` on triggers, cyclic subscriptions and fault triggers returns a usable ``Location``, and every ``Location`` is canonicalised - a request with a trailing slash used to yield a URI that answered ``404`` (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* Entity detail responses advertise ``data-categories`` and ``data-groups`` on every entity type, ``locks`` on components and apps where locking is configured, and ``fault-triggers`` on apps; the ``capabilities`` array now lists the collections each entity type actually serves. Two operation ids are added, ``getCapabilityDescription`` and ``getScopedCapabilityDescription``; no existing operation id was renamed and no route was added to or removed from the served API (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* The root endpoint list includes plugin-mounted routes, and an SSE cyclic-subscription error frame carries ``vendor_code`` alongside its ``error_code`` (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)
* In-flight update tasks are drained before their notifier is destroyed, closing a shutdown race (`#591 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/591>`_)

0.6.0 (2026-06-22)
------------------
* SOVD entity status and lifecycle control endpoints: ``GET /apps/{id}/status`` and ``GET /components/{id}/status``, plus lifecycle control routes backed by a new ``LifecycleProvider`` plugin interface and plugin-manager routing. Control returns ``501 Not Implemented`` until a provider is registered; the routes are RBAC-gated, advertised via a ``status`` link on app and component detail, and declared under the OpenAPI ``Lifecycle`` tag (`#437 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/437>`_)
* Accurate app and component status: app status is read from the managed-node lifecycle state through a ``GetState``-backed reader, and a component reports ``notReady`` when all hosted apps are offline while staying ``ready`` as long as it is reachable (`#455 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/455>`_)
* Bounded the executor and HTTP server thread pools, sized to the cold-wait plus SSE budget, with misconfiguration guards and a bounded keep-alive timeout (`#457 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/457>`_)
* Startup discovery summary logged at boot, with an empty-graph warning when no entities are discovered (`#438 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/438>`_)
* Bounded the unsupported-message-type cache and exposed its size; unknown message types now warn once instead of on every sample (`#450 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/450>`_)
* OpenAPI query parameters are derived from a typed query contract, tightening the query-parameter schema and its regression gate (`#417 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/417>`_)
* ``PluginContext`` can aggregate peer faults across daisy-chained gateways through the SOVD service interface (`#419 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/419>`_)
* Single-command bringup of the local medkit stack via ``bringup.launch.py`` and ``bringup_params.yaml`` (`#439 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/439>`_)
* Docker image enables CORS for the documented web UI path and uses explicit web UI origins instead of wildcard CORS (`#452 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/452>`_)
* Docker image bundles the CycloneDDS RMW as an opt-in alternative implementation (`#451 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/451>`_)
* Native gateway launch enables web UI CORS by default and honors the CORS settings from a supplied ``config_file`` (`#461 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/461>`_)
* Incremental, embedded-hardened entity cache: ``ThreadSafeEntityCache`` stores entities in a fixed-capacity ``SlotStore`` object pool indexed by open-addressed flat hash maps, and ``update_all`` reconciles the discovery output by id (add / remove / change only) so steady-state refresh does zero structural allocations. Capacity is reserved via ``entity_cache.capacity`` (default 256) and cache stats are exposed on ``/health`` as ``x-medkit-entity-cache``. Discovery refreshes are debounced via ``discovery.refresh_debounce_ms`` (default 1000) and operation ``type_info`` schemas resolve lazily, cutting gateway CPU under graph churn roughly 4x. Entity detail ``operations[]`` no longer embeds schemas eagerly; the schemas remain on the ``/operations`` resource (`#462 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/462>`_)

0.5.0 (2026-06-08)
------------------

**Breaking Changes:**

* Typed router refactor. ``HandlerContext`` no longer carries
  ``send_json`` / ``send_error`` / ``send_plugin_error`` / ``send_dto`` /
  ``parse_body``: handlers return ``http::Result<TResponse>`` and the
  framework owns response writing through ``RouteRegistry``. The raw
  ``void(httplib::Request, httplib::Response)`` ``RouteRegistry`` lambda
  overloads are removed - call sites must use the typed
  ``reg.get<T>`` / ``reg.post<TBody, T>`` / ``reg.del<T>`` overloads, the
  multi-shape ``reg.post_alternates<TBody, TAlt...>`` /
  ``reg.del_alternates<TAlt...>``, or one of the named escape hatches
  (``reg.sse`` / ``reg.binary_download`` / ``reg.multipart_upload<T>`` /
  ``reg.static_asset`` / ``reg.docs_endpoint`` / ``reg.docs_subtree``).
  ``static_assert(dto::has_dto_shape_v<T>)`` gates every typed overload, so
  non-DTO return types fail at compile time. The plugin ABI is unaffected:
  ``PluginResponse`` keeps its ``send_json`` / ``send_error`` surface and
  now routes through the same internal ``http::detail::write_json_body``
  primitive as the framework, so plugin wire format is unchanged
  (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* Provider ABI typed. ``FaultProvider``, ``DataProvider``,
  ``OperationProvider``, and ``UpdateProvider::get_update`` return typed
  DTO envelopes (``FaultListResult`` / ``FaultDetailResult`` /
  ``FaultClearResult`` / the matching ``Data*Result`` and
  ``Operation*Result`` shapes / ``UpdateStatusResult``) instead of raw
  ``tl::expected<nlohmann::json, ErrorInfo>``. The wire bytes are
  byte-identical because each envelope wraps an opaque ``content`` object
  emitted verbatim by ``JsonWriter``; commercial and out-of-tree plugins
  must wrap their existing JSON in the matching envelope type
  (mechanical: ``Result.content = std::move(json_payload)``). The plugin
  ABI itself (``PluginRoute`` shape, ``PluginResponse`` ctor, plugin api
  version) is locked by ``test_plugin_abi_conformance`` and is unchanged
  (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* ``SchemaWriter`` emits optional DTO fields as
  ``anyOf: [<inner>, {type: "null"}]`` (the OpenAPI 3.1 idiom) instead of
  ``nullable: true``. Generated clients see ``T | null`` for every optional
  field rather than ``T | undefined``. Wire format is unchanged - the
  gateway still omits absent optional fields, and ``JsonReader`` continues
  to accept absent fields; the schema change only opts the published spec
  into round-tripping a literal ``null`` value cleanly for clients that
  prefer to send one. As part of this, a handful of fields that were
  previously emitted as an explicit JSON ``null`` when absent are now omitted
  entirely (consistent with the optional-omission policy): the script
  execution fields ``progress`` / ``started_at`` / ``completed_at`` /
  ``parameters`` / ``error`` (``GET .../scripts/{id}/executions/{eid}``) and
  the script ``parameters_schema`` field (``GET .../scripts/{id}``). Clients
  that tested ``field === null`` or relied on the key always being present must
  treat an absent key the same as ``null``
  (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* Synchronous operation-execution service-call failures
  (``POST /api/v1/{entity-path}/operations/{id}/executions`` when the underlying
  ROS 2 service call fails) now return the standard SOVD ``GenericError`` envelope
  (``{"error_code": "vendor-error", "vendor_code":
  "x-medkit-ros2-service-unavailable", "message": "Service call failed", ...}``,
  HTTP status 500 unchanged) instead of the previous bespoke nested
  ``{"error": {"code", "message", "details"}}`` object. This aligns the one
  remaining non-standard error path with every other gateway error; clients that
  parsed ``error.code`` / ``error.details`` for this specific failure must read
  ``vendor_code`` / ``parameters`` instead
  (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* ``GET /api/v1/{entity-path}/data`` now publishes the opaque ``DataListResult``
  schema (``{type: object, additionalProperties: true, x-medkit-opaque: true}``),
  matching how ``GET .../faults`` already publishes ``FaultListResult``. The wire
  payload is unchanged for runtime (ROS 2) entities - it is still
  ``{"items": [...], "x-medkit": {...}}`` built from the typed
  ``Collection<DataItem, DataListXMedkit>`` - but for plugin-owned entities the
  provider's free-form per-item shape now passes through verbatim instead of
  being re-parsed into ``Collection<DataItem>``. This fixes a regression in which
  plugin per-item fields (the OPC-UA plugin's ``value`` / ``unit`` / ``data_type``
  / ``writable``) were silently dropped by the typed re-parse. Clients that
  generated a typed ``DataItem`` model from the previous spec for this route now
  see an opaque object instead
  (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* Entity responses (areas, components, apps, functions - list items and detail)
  now always carry a top-level ``type`` discriminator (an enum of
  ``area`` / ``component`` / ``app`` / ``function``). Previously list items had no
  ``type`` and detail responses exposed it only inside ``x-medkit.entityType``.
  Additive and tolerant-client-safe; consumers keying on the entity kind can now
  read the top-level ``type``
  (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* ``ros2_medkit_msgs/srv/ClearFault`` request gains a ``bool skip_correlation_auto_clear`` field (see the per-entity fault scope entry below for the in-tree motivation). Adding a request field changes the service type hash, so out-of-tree callers that invoke the service directly (for example ``ros2 service call /fault_manager/clear_fault ros2_medkit_msgs/srv/ClearFault ...`` as documented in the ``ros2_medkit_fault_manager`` README) must rebuild against the new ``ros2_medkit_msgs`` to keep talking to ``fault_manager``. The in-tree gateway client and server are updated together (`#395 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/395>`_)
* Per-entity fault routes are now correctly scoped to the entity's hosted apps. ``GET /api/v1/{entity-path}/faults/{fault_code}``, ``DELETE /api/v1/{entity-path}/faults/{fault_code}``, ``GET /api/v1/{entity-path}/faults``, and ``DELETE /api/v1/{entity-path}/faults`` previously fell back to a prefix match against the entity's ``namespace_path``; when that was empty (host-derived / synthetic components, manifest components without a ``namespace`` field, Areas, Functions, and Apps with a wildcard ``ros_binding.namespace_pattern``) the scope filter was silently disabled and the routes exposed - and on ``DELETE``, cleared - faults reported by apps that belonged to entirely different entities. All four handlers now resolve the addressed entity to its hosted-app FQN set (via the new ``HandlerContext::resolve_entity_source_fqns`` helper) and apply a strict all-sources scope check: a fault counts as in scope only when **every** entry in its ``reporting_sources`` is owned by the entity (exact FQN match, or strict path-child via ``<fqn>/...``). Per-fault routes return ``404 Resource Not Found`` for any fault that fails the check; collection routes return an empty ``items`` array. The underlying ``GetFault.srv`` contract is unchanged; ``ClearFault.srv`` gains a new ``skip_correlation_auto_clear`` request flag so per-entity DELETE can opt out of cascade-clearing correlated symptom fault codes that may live in other entities. Per-entity collection responses no longer include the global ``muted_count`` / ``cluster_count`` / ``muted_faults`` / ``clusters`` correlation metadata; those remain on the global ``GET /api/v1/faults`` route. Behavior changes visible to clients: (a) faults reported by apps outside the addressed entity are no longer returned or cleared via that entity's route, (b) **mixed-source** faults that include at least one out-of-entity reporter are likewise rejected with ``404`` on per-fault routes and excluded from per-entity collection responses (use the global ``GET /api/v1/faults`` to see them), (c) per-entity DELETE no longer cascade-clears correlated symptoms outside the entity (`#395 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/395>`_)
* ``GET /api/v1/updates/{id}/status`` no longer returns ``404`` for a registered-but-idle package; ``POST /api/v1/updates`` now seeds a ``pending`` status, so the endpoint returns ``200 {"status": "pending"}`` immediately after registration. ``404`` is reserved for packages that are not registered. Clients that used ``404`` as a signal for "registered but nothing started yet" must adapt (`#378 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/378>`_)

**Features:**

* Typed ``fan_out_collection<T>`` aggregating helper replaces raw-JSON ``merge_peer_items`` on the typed collection routes (data, operations, config, logs). Peer items are decoded via ``dto::JsonReader<T>``; items that fail validation are removed from the merged ``items`` array, recorded in ``x-medkit.peer_dropped_items`` with the JsonReader error plus a best-effort ``source_id``, and logged at ``WARN``. Items that parse successfully are re-serialized through the local ``dto::JsonWriter<T>``, so any peer-supplied fields outside the local DTO schema are dropped from the merged response (the previous raw passthrough preserved unknown peer fields verbatim). Previously, malformed peer items silently disappeared into the merged response; fleet operators can now detect inter-gateway schema drift directly on the wire (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* ``Collection<T, XMedkitT>`` is now a 2-parameter template. Domain list endpoints (faults, config, logs) reference their richer per-domain collection x-medkit struct (``FaultListXMedkit``, ``ConfigListXMedkit``, ``LogListXMedkit``) directly in the published schema instead of the generic ``XMedkitCollection``, so generated clients see aggregation counts, peer provenance, and ``peer_dropped_items`` from the schema. The data list builds the same typed ``Collection<DataItem, DataListXMedkit>`` internally (so the wire still carries those fields) but publishes the opaque ``DataListResult`` envelope, because plugin-owned data entities can return vendor per-item fields the typed item schema cannot describe (see the data-list breaking-change entry above) (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* New ``opaque_object("key", &T::field)`` DTO field descriptor in ``dto/contract.hpp``. Binds a ``nlohmann::json`` member as a typed "any JSON object" field: ``JsonWriter`` emits it verbatim, ``JsonReader`` rejects scalars / arrays / null, ``SchemaWriter`` emits ``{type: object, additionalProperties: true, x-medkit-opaque: true}``. Used for fields whose runtime shape is decided by an upstream component the gateway cannot introspect (live ROS message payloads, plugin-defined fault envelopes, action results) (`#403 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/403>`_)
* ``GET /api/v1/faults/stream`` event payloads now carry an optional ``x-medkit`` SOVD payload-extension object with ``entity_type`` and ``entity_id`` fields. When the gateway can resolve the fault's first reporting source back to a SOVD entity (via the manifest-mode linking index, or a runtime-mode last-segment match against an existing App), consumers can hit ``/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/bulk-data/rosbags/{fault_code}`` directly instead of HEAD-probing every entity. Resolution is snapshotted at event arrival, so a discovery refresh between enqueue and stream-out cannot retroactively change the entity reported to consumers. The ``x-medkit`` object is omitted entirely when no entity can be resolved, so existing SSE consumers ignore the addition (`#380 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/380>`_)
* Plugin API version bumped to v7. Adds ``PluginContext::notify_entities_changed(EntityChangeScope)`` lifecycle hook for plugins that mutate the entity surface at runtime; default no-op keeps v6 source code compiling unchanged against v7 headers. Binary compatibility is not provided: the plugin loader uses a strict equality check on ``plugin_api_version()``, so out-of-tree plugins must be recompiled (`#376 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/376>`_)
* New ``discovery.manifest.fragments_dir`` parameter: gateway scans the directory for ``*.yaml`` / ``*.yml`` fragment files on every manifest load / reload and merges apps, components, and functions on top of the base manifest. Fragments are forbidden from declaring top-level ``areas``, ``metadata``, ``discovery``, ``scripts``, ``capabilities``, or ``lock_overrides`` - those stay in the base manifest. Presence of any forbidden key (including empty-valued ones like ``areas: []``) is reported as a ``FRAGMENT_FORBIDDEN_FIELD`` validation error that fails the load / reload. Unknown top-level keys (typos such as ``app:`` vs ``apps:``) are ignored with a warning log. Files merged in alphabetical order for deterministic duplicate-id errors (`#376 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/376>`_)
* Fragment files are size-capped at 1 MiB (``ManifestParser::kMaxFragmentBytes``) before being read into memory, and any symlink resolving outside the canonical ``fragments_dir`` is skipped with a warning, so misconfigurations or symlink-based escapes cannot hand arbitrary bytes to the YAML parser (`#376 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/376>`_)
* All-or-nothing fragment semantics: a single malformed or forbidden fragment fails the entire load / reload and keeps the previously-loaded manifest active (`#376 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/376>`_)
* ``ManifestParser::parse_fragment_file`` convenience entrypoint that injects a synthetic ``manifest_version`` header when the fragment omits one
* See ``design/plugin_entity_notifications.rst`` for the lifecycle, merge-rule, and plugin-side write-contract walkthrough
* New ``GET /api/v1/apps/{app_id}/belongs-to`` discovery endpoint returning the areas and components an app belongs to; the ``belongs-to`` URI is advertised on ``GET /apps/{app_id}`` (`#196 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/196>`_)
* Pool-backed ``TopicDataProvider`` for live topic data: a shared subscription pool owned by a single-writer executor node, with LRU and idle eviction and publisher-QoS matching, replacing per-request subscriptions. Pool and executor health are surfaced as the ``x-medkit-subscription-executor`` vendor-extension stats on ``GET /api/v1/health``, read atomically so ``/health`` never blocks under load (`#384 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/issues/384>`_)
* ``GET /api/v1/updates/{id}/status`` exposes the update lifecycle ``phase`` under the response ``x-medkit`` object
* ``gateway.launch.py`` and ``gateway_https.launch.py`` accept a ``config_file`` launch argument pointing at an external parameter YAML. Parameters present in the file override the matching gateway defaults; parameters the file omits keep their launch defaults instead of being reset (`#408 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/408>`_)
* Plugin-facing headers are httplib-free across the ``.so`` boundary: the handler-result vocabulary (``Result``, ``NoContent``, ``Forwarded``, ``ValidatorResult``, ``ResponseAttachments``) moved to a new leaf header ``http/handler_result.hpp`` so provider and DTO interfaces no longer transitively include ``<httplib.h>``. Out-of-tree plugins built against the installed gateway (build-farm / Docker topology, where the vendored httplib is not on the include path) compile again; no ABI, wire, or behaviour change. A pre-push gate and CI scan keep the plugin-facing headers httplib-free (`#411 <https://github.com/selfpatch/ros2_medkit/pull/411>`_)
