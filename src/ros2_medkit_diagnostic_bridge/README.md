# ros2_medkit_diagnostic_bridge

Bridge node that converts ROS2 `/diagnostics` messages to FaultManager faults.

## Overview

This package provides backwards compatibility with existing ROS2 diagnostic infrastructure.
It subscribes to the standard `/diagnostics` topic and forwards diagnostic status messages
to the FaultManager as faults.

## Severity Mapping

| DiagnosticStatus Level | Fault Severity | Action |
|------------------------|----------------|--------|
| OK (0) | - | Sends PASSED event (healing) |
| WARN (1) | WARN (1) | Reports fault |
| ERROR (2) | ERROR (2) | Reports fault |
| STALE (3) | `stale_severity` (CRITICAL by default) | Reports fault |

STALE is the one level whose severity is a deployment decision rather than a fact. A GPS in
every tunnel and a dead sensor both publish STALE, and CRITICAL
[bypasses debounce](../ros2_medkit_fault_manager/README.md), so an expected outage confirms a
CRITICAL fault on its first sample. Set `stale_severity`, or name the noisy sources with
`stale_severity_overrides`, and those statuses go through debounce like any other.

## Evidence

A FAILED report carries the status's key-values to the fault manager, which keeps them in the
fault's freeze frame under the reserved key `x-reported` and serves them back from
`GET /api/v1/apps/{app}/faults/{code}`:

```jsonc
{
  "environment_data": {
    "snapshots": [
      {
        "type": "freeze_frame",
        "name": "freeze_frame",
        "data": "{\"x-reported\":{\"rejected_fixes\":\"37\",\"nis\":\"0.03\"}}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The numbers a publisher already computed to decide something was wrong are usually the whole
explanation of the fault, and before this they were dropped. The frame's other keys are topic
names sampled by the fault manager, which are always fully qualified and start with `/`, so a
reader can always tell a value the reporter asserted from one the fault manager sampled.

`keyvalue_codes` still reads the same values to pick a fault code; the two uses are
independent and either can be used without the other. Evidence is bounded per fault code (32
entries, 512 characters per value); entries past the bound are dropped with a throttled
warning rather than truncated, and the fault is recorded either way.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start FaultManager first
ros2 run ros2_medkit_fault_manager fault_manager_node

# Start DiagnosticBridge
ros2 run ros2_medkit_diagnostic_bridge diagnostic_bridge_node
```

## Configuration

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `diagnostics_topic` | string | `/diagnostics` | Topic to subscribe to |
| `auto_generate_codes` | bool | `true` | Auto-generate fault codes from diagnostic names |
| `use_hardware_id_as_source_id` | bool | `false` | Use slash-containing diagnostic `hardware_id` values as fault `source_id` |
| `max_tracked_sources` | integer | `512` | Maximum number of per-source FaultReporter instances retained by the bridge |
| `name_to_code.<name>` | string | - | Custom mapping from diagnostic name to fault code |
| `keyvalue_codes` | string[] | - | List of keys used to search the diagnostic values for the fault code |
| `stale_severity` | string | `CRITICAL` | Severity a STALE status reports at. One of `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` |
| `stale_severity_overrides.<name>` | string | - | Severity for STALE statuses whose name starts with `<name>`. Longest matching prefix wins |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
diagnostic_bridge:
  ros__parameters:
    diagnostics_topic: "/diagnostics"
    auto_generate_codes: true
    # Opt in to source attribution from diagnostic hardware_id values
    use_hardware_id_as_source_id: false
    max_tracked_sources: 512

    # Custom mappings (optional)
    # Format: "name_to_code.<diagnostic_name>": "<FAULT_CODE>"
    "name_to_code.motor_controller: Temperature": "MOTOR_OVERHEAT"
    "name_to_code.battery_monitor: Voltage": "BATTERY_LOW"
```

### Fault Code Generation

When `auto_generate_codes` is enabled, diagnostic names are converted to fault codes:

| Diagnostic Name | Generated Fault Code |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| `motor temp` | `MOTOR_TEMP` |
| `motor: Status` | `MOTOR_STATUS` |
| `/robot/sensor` | `ROBOT_SENSOR` |

Custom mappings in `name_to_code` take priority over auto-generation.

### Fault Source Attribution

By default, faults reported by this bridge use the bridge node's fully-qualified
name (`/diagnostic_bridge`) as their `source_id`. This preserves the behavior of
existing deployments because `DiagnosticStatus.hardware_id` commonly contains a
serial number, device path, or no value rather than a ROS node name.

Set `use_hardware_id_as_source_id` to `true` to opt in to hardware ID attribution.
When enabled, a non-empty `hardware_id` is used exactly as provided only when it
contains `/`, which is treated as a heuristic for a node/FQN-like identifier.
Empty or non-slash hardware IDs fall back to the bridge FQN. This option does not
perform manifest lookup or normalize hardware IDs; the accepted value must already
match the runtime entity source ID used by the gateway.

The bridge keeps one `FaultReporter` per active source so local filtering remains
isolated by source. `max_tracked_sources` bounds this cache with least-recently-used
eviction; values below `1` are clamped to `1`.

## Launch

```bash
# Using launch file with default config
ros2 launch ros2_medkit_diagnostic_bridge diagnostic_bridge.launch.py

# With custom config
ros2 launch ros2_medkit_diagnostic_bridge diagnostic_bridge.launch.py \
    config_file:=/path/to/custom_config.yaml
```

## Integration with FaultManager

For full healing support, configure FaultManager with:

```yaml
fault_manager:
  ros__parameters:
    healing_enabled: true
    healing_threshold: 1
```

When a diagnostic transitions from ERROR/STALE to OK, the bridge sends a PASSED event,
allowing the fault to heal in FaultManager.

## Building

```bash
colcon build --packages-select ros2_medkit_diagnostic_bridge
```

## Testing

```bash
colcon test --packages-select ros2_medkit_diagnostic_bridge
colcon test-result --verbose
```
