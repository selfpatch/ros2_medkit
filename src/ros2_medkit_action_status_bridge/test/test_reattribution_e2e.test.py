"""
End-to-end regression for provisional-source re-attribution (issue #467).

This drives the REAL action_status_bridge (not a hand-rolled reporter) against a
real FaultManager. The only substitution is a test-double executable that forces
the inherently racy DDS-FQN resolution to return "" for the first few rescans,
reproducing the "action aborts before discovery resolves the server FQN" race
deterministically. Everything else - reporter_for's provisional bookkeeping,
reattribute_provisional(), report() with supersedes_source_id, the rescan timer -
is the unmodified production bridge.

Asserted end to end:
  1. the fault first surfaces under the provisional action-name source
     (/test_action), because the FQN was unresolved at first report; then
  2. once the FQN resolves, the bridge re-reports under it with the provisional
     source superseded, so reporting_sources ends as {FQN} with the provisional
     source dropped.

Step 2 is the exact behavior that was impossible before #467 (append-only
reporting_sources + strict-AND per-entity scope filter left the fault stuck
under the provisional source forever).
