Main Components
---------------

1. **FaultManagerNode** - The main ROS 2 node that provides fault management services
   - Extends ``rclcpp::Node``
   - Owns a ``FaultStorage`` implementation for fault state persistence
   - Provides three ROS 2 services for fault reporting, querying, and clearing
   - Validates input parameters (fault_code, severity, source_id)
   - Logs fault lifecycle events at appropriate severity levels

2. **FaultStorage** - Abstract interface for fault storage backends
   - Defines the contract for fault storage implementations
   - Enables pluggable storage backends (in-memory, persistent, distributed)
   - Future implementations can be added in Issue #8: Fault Persistence Options

3. **InMemoryFaultStorage** - Thread-safe in-memory implementation of FaultStorage
   - Uses ``std::map`` keyed by ``FaultId`` for O(log n) lookups, ordered by code first
   - Protected by ``std::mutex`` for concurrent service request handling
   - Keeps one record per reporting source, filtered and cleared independently
   - Implements severity escalation per record (higher severity overwrites lower)
   - Tracks occurrence counts per record

4. **FaultState** - Internal representation of one fault record
   - Maps directly to ``ros2_medkit_msgs::msg::Fault`` via ``to_msg()``
   - Carries its owner and emits it as the single entry of reporting_sources
   - Tracks first and last occurrence timestamps
   - Manages fault status lifecycle with debounce (PREFAILED -> CONFIRMED -> CLEARED)

5. **CaptureThreadPool** - Bounded worker pool for snapshot capture
   Under a fault storm the node enqueues capture jobs into a bounded ``CaptureThreadPool``
   (``pool_size`` workers draining a ``queue_depth``-bounded queue) rather than spawning one
   thread per fault. The full-queue policy (``reject_newest``/``drop_oldest``) bounds memory,
   and the destructor joins the pool before rosbag teardown.

Services
--------

~/report_fault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reports a new fault or updates an existing one.

- **Input validation**: fault_code and source_id cannot be empty, event_type must be valid
- **Event types**: FAILED (fault detected) or PASSED (fault condition cleared)
- **Debounce**: FAILED events decrement counter, PASSED events increment counter
- **Record identity**: (fault_code, source_id). The same fault_code from different sources
  creates one record per source, each debounced, cleared and healed on its own
- **Severity escalation**: A record's severity is updated if its own owner reports a higher one
- **Returns**: ``accepted=true`` if event was processed

~/list_faults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries faults with optional filtering.

- **Status filter**: Filter by status (PREFAILED, PREPASSED, CONFIRMED, HEALED, CLEARED); defaults to CONFIRMED
- **Severity filter**: When ``filter_by_severity=true``, returns only faults of specified severity
- **Returns**: List of ``Fault`` messages matching the filter criteria

~/clear_fault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clears (acknowledges) a fault by setting its status to CLEARED.

- **Input validation**: fault_code cannot be empty
- **Idempotent**: Clearing an already-cleared fault succeeds
- **Returns**: ``success=true`` if fault existed, ``success=false`` if not found

Design Decisions
----------------

Thread Safety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All ``FaultStorage`` public methods acquire a mutex lock to ensure thread safety
when handling concurrent service requests. This is essential since ROS 2 service
callbacks may execute on different threads.

Fault Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fault record is identified by the pair ``(fault_code, source_id)``, where the
``source_id`` is the one the ``ReportFault`` call carried. That source is the record's
owner. Repeated reports from one source update that source's record. A report from a
source that owns no record for the code opens a new one. This provides:

- **Deduplication**: Prevents fault flooding from one source's repeated reports
- **Source attribution**: Each record names the one source that owns it
- **Occurrence counting**: Tracks how many times a record was raised

Keeping the records apart is what makes the per-source state mean anything: the debounce
counter, the status, the severity, the occurrence count and the timestamps all belong to
one reporter, so one reporter recovering cannot walk another reporter's fault back from
confirmation, and one reporter's CRITICAL cannot escalate another's record.

Severity Escalation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a record is re-reported by its owner with a higher severity, the stored severity is
updated. This ensures the record reflects the worst-case condition its own reporter saw.
Severity levels are ordered:
``INFO(0) < WARN(1) < ERROR(2) < CRITICAL(3)``.

Status Lifecycle (Debounce Model)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Faults follow an AUTOSAR DEM-style debounce lifecycle:

- **PREFAILED**: Debounce counter < 0 but above confirmation threshold (fault trending towards confirmation)
- **PREPASSED**: Debounce counter > 0 but below healing threshold (fault trending towards healing)
- **CONFIRMED**: Debounce counter <= confirmation threshold (e.g., -3). Fault is active and verified.
- **HEALED**: Debounce counter >= healing threshold (if healing enabled). Fault resolved by PASSED events.
- **CLEARED**: Fault manually acknowledged via ClearFault service

FAILED events decrement the debounce counter (towards confirmation).
PASSED events increment the debounce counter (towards healing).
CRITICAL severity bypasses debounce and confirms immediately.

The counter is always clamped to ``[confirmation_threshold, healing_threshold]`` so a long run of
one-sided events cannot push it out to the integer limits and delay the opposite transition.

CONFIRMED and HEALED are *latched* (hysteresis): once reached, the status holds until the counter
walks all the way to the opposite threshold. So PREFAILED/PREPASSED depend on the counter sign, but
a CONFIRMED or HEALED fault keeps its status while the counter is between the thresholds - a single
opposite-direction event cannot flip it. One consequence is a re-confirmation delay: a fault that
becomes active again is not back in the default (CONFIRMED-only) list until the counter has fallen by
up to ``healing_threshold - confirmation_threshold`` events. During that window ``last_occurred``
still reflects the activity; ``occurrence_count`` does not, because it counts the edge that started
the occurrence, not every report within it.

Thresholds must satisfy ``confirmation_threshold < 0 <= healing_threshold`` (``healing_threshold == 0``
means heal on a single PASSED event); the node validates the
merged per-entity config at startup, logs a warning, and falls back to safe defaults if not. When
healing is disabled, any HEALED row left by a previous (healing-enabled) run is reclassified to
CLEARED once at startup so it does not behave inconsistently under the latch.

Rosbag Black-Box Recording
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``RosbagCapture`` is a single-writer black box: one ring buffer, one open bag writer and
one post-fault window per fault manager. Everything below follows from that.

Subscriptions feed a ``std::deque`` of serialised messages, pruned to ``duration_sec`` of
history and to ``max_buffer_mb`` of RAM. Pruning is driven by message arrival, not by a
timer, and each arrival prunes the whole deque by age - so a single topic going quiet is
pruned like anything else, while a system where *everything* goes quiet keeps its last
window buffered rather than silently losing the final messages before it died.

On confirmation the whole buffer is moved out in one step and written to a new bag. If
``duration_after_sec > 0`` the writer stays open and the state machine enters the
post-fault window: ``recording_post_fault_`` is set, a one-shot timer is armed, and from
that point incoming messages bypass the buffer and are written straight to the open bag.
When the timer fires (or ``stop()`` runs first), the recording is finalised: the writer
closes and one metadata row is stored per fault the recording covers.

The window boundary
"""""""""""""""""""

The interesting transition is the second one. The branch is on the buffer, not on window
history: a confirmation that finds nothing buffered opens a post-fault-only recording,
whatever emptied the buffer.

Right after a window finalises the buffer is empty as far as the capture's own message
flow goes: the flush that opened the recording drained it, and every message published
during the window went into that bag instead of back into the buffer. A fault confirming
in that gap - typically the next fault of the same burst - therefore has no pre-fault
history to write.

Two things qualify "empty". A message arriving between the drain and the guard being
published is still buffered, and more importantly the broad topic modes (``all``,
``auto``, ``entity``) subscribe to ``/fault_manager/events``: reporting a fault publishes
an event there, so on a real fault manager the act of reporting refills the buffer, and
the boundary case belongs mainly to a narrowed capture - ``explicit``, a topic list,
``config``, or a broad mode excluding that topic. ``test_rosbag_boundary_scope.test.py``
excludes it for exactly this reason, and says so.

It is not the only one. A fault confirming before anything has been published on a
captured topic - at startup, or with ``lazy_start`` - finds the same empty buffer and gets
the same post-fault-only bag, with no window having closed beforehand.

Before, ``flush_to_bag()`` returned an empty path and the confirmation was abandoned with
a warning: no bag, no metadata row, no retry, and every later retrieval for that fault
failed permanently. Now the empty buffer is distinguished from a write failure, and it
opens a recording anyway - a post-fault-only bag. Because it is the ordinary post-roll
state machine, attachment, entity scoping, auto-cleanup and quota accounting all behave
as for any other recording.

Two states stay deliberately empty-handed:

- ``duration_after_sec == 0``: there is no window to record into and no history to write,
  so the fault gets no bag.
- an I/O failure (unwritable ``storage_path``, unusable storage backend): no post-roll is
  opened on top of it, so no row is ever stored for a bag that does not exist.

``flush_to_bag()`` reports ``kOk`` / ``kEmptyBuffer`` / ``kIoError`` rather than one
overloaded empty-string return, and the writer-open block lives in ``open_bag_writer()``
so it can run without any buffered messages.

Handing a recording over
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Confirmations run on the capture pool and the post-fault timer runs on the executor. The
node-level rosbag mutex serialises confirmations against each other but not against the
timer, so ``post_fault_timer_mutex_`` is the only thing ordering the two - and clearing
the recording guard is precisely the signal that lets the next confirmation open a bag of
its own. Everything that belongs to the recording therefore changes hands inside one
critical section: the guard, the start time and the writer. Releasing the guard first and
reaching for ``writer_mutex_`` afterwards leaves a gap in which the incoming confirmation
installs its writer and the outgoing finalise then destroys it, after which the new
recording writes through a null pointer - every message dropped - and still stores a row
for the empty bag it produced. The writer is *closed* only after all three of
``post_fault_timer_mutex_``, ``capture_topics_mutex_`` and ``writer_mutex_`` are released,
once it is exclusively the finalise's own, because flushing a bag is real I/O. It is not
closed unsynchronised, though. It is closed under a different lock, and that lock exists
for a reason that has nothing to do with this class's state.

Closing a bag, and the lock that is not the data lock
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``~Writer`` can unload the storage plugin's shared library and ``open()`` loads it, and the
state both touch is **process-global**: ``class_loader`` keeps one registry of loaded
libraries keyed by library path, so every writer of a given format shares one
``rcutils_shared_library_t`` no matter which thread, which ``RosbagCapture`` or which
``FaultManagerNode`` created it. A close racing an open puts two threads into ``dlclose``
on the same handle. The winner closes it and zeroes the struct; the loser's ``dlclose``
reports "shared object not open" and then calls the now-null ``allocator.deallocate``,
and the process dies in ``rcutils_unload_shared_library`` with the instruction pointer at
zero. Reproduced outside this package with threads doing nothing but open/close loops on
one format: four threads x 200 iterations failed in 20 of 20 runs on ``mcap`` and in 20 of
20 on ``sqlite3``, so it belongs to neither backend and to no single instance.

An instance member cannot serialise process-global state, so the lock is a file-scope
``plugin_mutex()`` in ``rosbag_capture.cpp``, held across a writer's construction, its
``open()`` and its destruction, on every path that has one: both finalise paths,
``discard_active_writer()``, the destructor, and the storage-backend probe that every
capture runs while it is being constructed. ``open()`` is inside the lock deliberately -
the constructor reaches no loader, the open is what loads the plugin, and a lock around
construction and destruction alone still let failures through. The mutex is leaked on
purpose (a ``new std::mutex`` that is never deleted): a static mutex destroyed during
static destruction, while another thread is closing a bag, reopens the very window it
exists to close. With it, the same loops ran 0 failures in 112000 operations on each
backend.

It is deliberately **not** ``writer_mutex_``. That lock is taken by ``message_callback()``
for every message of a post-roll and by the flush loop for every buffered message, so
charging a close to it would stall the capture's own write path for the length of a flush
plus a ``metadata.yaml`` write. Keeping the close off the data lock was the original
design's call, and the cost it avoided is real; what it left unpaid was safety. Measured on
one workstation, single-threaded: a close costs about 0.37 ms for a bag with no messages
(200 samples) and about 1.1 ms for one holding 256 MB, the ring buffer's default RAM cap,
split at the default 50 MB per file (12 samples). A recording opening at that moment waits
behind that. The figure is small because closing flushes to the page cache and writes
``metadata.yaml``; it does not ``fsync``, so slow or synchronous storage will cost more.

The resulting order is ``node rosbag mutex -> post_fault_timer_mutex_ ->
{capture_topics_mutex_, writer_mutex_}`` plus ``plugin_mutex() -> writer_mutex_``, with
``buffer_mutex_`` never held across another lock. ``plugin_mutex()`` is taken in three
shapes: alone, to destroy a writer already moved out of ``active_writer_``; alone, across a
probe writer's construction, ``open()`` and destruction in ``default_storage_probe()``,
which never touches ``active_writer_`` at all; or as the outer of the pair in
``open_bag_writer()``. No path takes it while holding a lock of this class. That is what
fixes the shape every destruction site shares - move the writer out of ``active_writer_``
under ``writer_mutex_``, release ``writer_mutex_``, then destroy under ``plugin_mutex()``.
Resetting in place under ``writer_mutex_`` would add the reverse edge and deadlock against
a concurrent ``open_bag_writer()``. That cycle is reachable precisely because the close sits
outside ``post_fault_timer_mutex_``: a confirmation running at the same time is not held at
the attach check, so it can be inside ``open_bag_writer()`` holding the plugin lock while
the finalise holds ``writer_mutex_`` and asks for it. Moving the close back inside
``post_fault_timer_mutex_`` would remove the cycle and reintroduce the stall the design
declines to pay for. Paths that take the capture-topics or writer locks on their own release
each before taking the next, so no other reverse edge exists and the order is acyclic.

Honest durations
""""""""""""""""

``RosbagFileInfo::duration_sec`` is the span the recording was open, tracked from the
timestamp of its oldest written message (or from the moment the writer opened, for a
post-fault-only bag). Both storage paths used to hardcode the configured windows, which
made a post-fault-only bag and a bag flushed from a half-filled buffer both claim a full
pre-fault window.

The span is measured on the **monotonic** clock, not the wall clock that timestamps
messages: a wall clock that steps backwards mid-window turns an elapsed time negative,
and the duration is then reported as zero. Message ages necessarily start out as wall-clock
differences, so a flush converts the history it found into a monotonic origin once and
measures forward from there. That conversion is capped at how long the capture has been
running - no bag can hold more history than that - because a clock step between buffering a
message and flushing it would otherwise land in the figure in full.

Measurement stops when the writer leaves ``message_callback``'s reach, inside the handover
critical section. Closing the bag flushes it and writes ``metadata.yaml``, and the size
walk recurses the directory; both scale with the bag and the storage, and neither adds a
message. Charging them to the recording would inflate a stored ``duration_sec`` without
bound on slow storage.

It is a recording span, not a content span. A post-fault-only window during which nothing
was published still reports its window: that statement is more useful to an operator than
a zero indistinguishable from a broken artifact, and it is the only definition every path
can produce without timestamping each message inside the post-roll write path, which runs
under ``writer_mutex_`` in the hot path. Because the buffer is pruned only on arrival, the
span can also legitimately exceed ``duration_sec + duration_after_sec``.

If the metadata row cannot be stored, the bag is discarded rather than kept: retrieval is
keyed by fault code and quota accounting enumerates rows, so a bag with no row would
occupy disk that nothing can find and nothing can evict.

Known interval: between the empty-buffer flush and the moment the recording guard is
published, the writer is being created - directory creation plus a storage-backend open.
Messages arriving in that interval take the buffering path rather than the new bag, so a
post-fault-only recording can miss its first few milliseconds. They are not lost; they
stay in the ring buffer and serve the next fault as pre-history.
