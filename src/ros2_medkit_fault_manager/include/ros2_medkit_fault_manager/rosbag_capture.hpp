/// Manages rosbag recording with ring buffer for time-window capture
///
/// This class implements a "black box" style recording where messages are
/// continuously buffered in memory. When a fault is confirmed, the buffer
/// is flushed to a bag file along with continued recording for a short
/// period after the fault.
///
/// Lifecycle:
/// - start() begins buffering messages (or lazy_start waits for PREFAILED)
/// - on_fault_confirmed() flushes buffer to bag file
/// - on_fault_cleared() deletes bag file if auto_cleanup enabled
///
/// Only one recording is open at a time (one ring buffer, one writer, one post-roll
/// state machine). Right after a post-fault window closes the ring buffer holds nothing
/// of the capture's own making: the flush that opened it moved the whole deque out, and
/// everything published during the window went straight to that bag instead of the
/// buffer. A fault confirming in that moment - typically the second fault of a burst -
/// therefore has no pre-fault history to write, and gets a post-fault-only recording
/// instead of nothing (a bag holding just its own duration_after_sec window). With
/// duration_after_sec == 0 no window exists and such a fault gets no bag.
///
/// How often that state is reached depends on the topic mode: the broad ones also
/// capture /fault_manager/events, and reporting a fault publishes there, so the next
/// fault usually finds that one message. See design/index.rst.
