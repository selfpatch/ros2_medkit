/// Manages rosbag recording with ring buffer for time-window capture
///
/// This class implements a "black box" style recording where messages are
/// continuously buffered in memory. When a fault is confirmed, the buffer
/// is flushed to a bag file along with continued recording for a short
/// period after the fault.
///
/// Lifecycle:
/// - start() begins buffering messages (or lazy_start waits for PREFAILED)
/// - on_fault_confirmed() flushes buffer to bag file
/// - on_fault_cleared() deletes bag file if auto_cleanup enabled
///
/// Only one recording is open at a time (one ring buffer, one writer, one post-roll
/// state machine). That makes the ring buffer empty by construction right after a
/// post-fault window closes: the flush that opened it moved the whole deque out, and
/// everything published during the window went straight to that bag instead of the
/// buffer. A fault confirming in that moment - typically the second fault of a burst -
/// therefore has no pre-fault history to write, and gets a post-fault-only recording
/// instead of nothing (a bag holding just its own duration_after_sec window). With
/// duration_after_sec == 0 no window exists and such a fault gets no bag.
