A planned stop declared before a restart is still in force after it.

The subject IS the restart, so the fault manager runs with ``respawn`` and the
test kills it by PID: a weekend stop must not end because the box rebooted.
Runs on SQLite, the shipped default and the only backend with a file behind it.
