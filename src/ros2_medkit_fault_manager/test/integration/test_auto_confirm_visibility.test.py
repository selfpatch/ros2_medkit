A time-based confirmation must be as visible as a reported one.

auto_confirm_after_sec promotes a fault that has sat in PREFAILED past its
window. The SSE fault feed the gateway serves, the trigger subscribers and the
per-entity freeze frames all key off the published event, and black-box capture
is enqueued alongside it. A promotion that only reaches the database is an alarm
nobody is told about and no recording is made for, so this pins both halves.
