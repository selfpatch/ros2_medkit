"""Shared launch_testing harness for ros2_medkit_graph_watchdog e2e tests.

Brings up a real gateway_node with the graph_watchdog plugin (.so) loaded,
a real fault_manager (memory storage, healing enabled), and caller-supplied
demo nodes - the only way to prove that nested plugin config actually
reaches a live detector through the real config-delivery path
(extract_plugin_config -> detector_config.hpp -> a detector's own
configure()). A C++ unit test cannot prove this: it hand-builds already-
nested JSON and calls configure() directly, bypassing the real gateway
parameter plumbing entirely - which is exactly what hid the flat/nested
bug this harness exists to catch a regression of.

Reuses the `ros2_medkit_test_utils` launch factories
(create_gateway_node, create_fault_manager_node, create_demo_nodes) so this
harness stays in lockstep with how the real gateway/fault_manager are
launched elsewhere. Requires `ros2_medkit_integration_tests` as a
package.xml test_depend (see CMakeLists.txt) so that package is importable
on PYTHONPATH once the workspace's install/setup.bash is sourced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector_params : dict or None
        Extra ``plugins.graph_watchdog.*`` ROS parameters (nested-dotted YAML
        keys, e.g. ``'plugins.graph_watchdog.detectors.param_drift.mode'``),
        merged on top of the ``plugins``/``plugins.graph_watchdog.path``
        parameters this factory always sets.
    extra_gateway_params : dict or None
        Extra ROS parameters for the gateway node itself rather than for the
        plugin (e.g. ``'parameter_service_negative_cache_sec'``). Kept separate
        from `detector_params` so a gateway-scope knob is not filed under a
        plugin-scope name; both end up in the same node config.
    demo_nodes : list of str or None
        Node keys from ``ros2_medkit_test_utils.launch_helpers.DEMO_NODE_REGISTRY``.
        ``None`` means no demo nodes.
    port : int or None
        Gateway HTTP port. ``None`` uses ``get_test_port()`` (the
        ``GATEWAY_TEST_PORT`` env var set per-CTest-target by CMake).
    demo_delay : float
        Seconds to delay demo nodes + fault_manager after gateway start.
    healing_enabled : bool
        Passed to the fault_manager as ``healing_enabled`` so a detector's
        level-triggered PASSED clears can actually advance the debounce
        counter to HEALED (see the plugin README, "Closing the loop").
    gateway_respawn : bool
        If True, ``launch`` restarts the gateway when it exits. For the one
        scenario whose subject is a gateway restart: the fault_manager and the
        demo nodes are separate processes, so killing only the gateway leaves
        a raised fault in the store and brings the plugin back with every
        detector counter at zero - the state no single-process launch can
        reach. Off by default so an unexpected gateway death stays a visible
        failure in every other scenario.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[LaunchDescription, dict]
        ``(launch_description, context_dict)`` expected by launch_testing.
        ``context_dict`` maps ``'gateway_node'`` to the gateway Node action.

def wait_until_watchdog_armed(port, timeout=60.0, interval=0.5, app_id=None):
    """Poll ``GET /api/v1/x-medkit-watchdog`` until the plugin is live and armed.

    Any assertion that a fault is ABSENT must gate on this first. Absence is the
    default outcome of a stack that never came up, and nothing else in a watchdog
    launch fails on one: the gateway logs and carries on when a plugin fails to
    dlopen, ``load_plugins``' return count is never checked, and a REST bind
    failure is caught inside the server thread. All of those still exit 0, so the
    post-shutdown exit-code check stays green too, and ``poll_faults`` swallows
    every transport error and returns ``None`` on timeout - exactly what an
    ``assertIsNone`` wants to see.

    This route is registered by the plugin itself (``get_routes()``), and its
    entity list is filled by the tick thread's gate update, so a 200 carrying
    entities proves BOTH that the .so loaded and that the tick loop ran.
    ``global_state == 'armed'`` additionally proves the bringup grace elapsed,
    i.e. the gate would have permitted a raise during the window that follows.

    `app_id` narrows that from "some app is armed" to "THIS app is armed", which
    is what a test that is about to perturb one specific node needs. The gate is
    what decides whether a detector may target an app at all (param_drift builds
    its read set from ``reliability_allows`` - see its tick()), so an armed
    entry is the precondition for the very first read of that node: gating on it
    means a perturbation can no longer land before the detector was even
    permitted to look, and a stack that comes up late fails HERE, naming the
    node, instead of surfacing later as an unexplained missing fault.

    The check mirrors ``ReliabilityGate::allows_raise``: the payload's
    per-entity ``state`` is ``armed`` only when the warmup has elapsed AND the
    lifecycle watcher considers the node ok, which is exactly the conjunction
    that permits a raise. The boolean ``armed`` field alone is only the warmup
    half.

    What this does NOT prove is that a detector has already READ the app - no
    e2e surface exposes that. The plugin's only route reports gate state, and a
    detector's level-triggered PASSED for a fault that does not exist yet is
    dropped by the fault_manager (see ``report_fault_event``), so a clear is
    invisible until something has been raised. Callers that need a captured
    baseline must still allow the sweep a window after this returns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    port : int
        Gateway HTTP port.
    timeout : float
        Maximum time to wait in seconds.
    interval : float

    app_id : str or None
        App id (as the gateway derives it from the ROS node name) that must be
        present in ``entities`` with ``state == 'armed'``. ``None`` only
        requires some entity plus a global ``armed`` state.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        ``True`` once the plugin reports a global ``armed`` state together with
        at least one entity (or with `app_id` armed, when given), ``False`` on
