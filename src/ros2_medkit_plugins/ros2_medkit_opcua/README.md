# ros2_medkit_opcua

Gateway plugin that bridges OPC-UA capable PLCs (OpenPLC, Siemens S7, Beckhoff, Allen-Bradley, etc.) into the SOVD entity tree. Enables unified diagnostics for mixed ROS 2 + industrial PLC deployments through a single REST API, with PLC alarms routed to `ros2_medkit_fault_manager` and numeric PLC values optionally bridged to ROS 2 `std_msgs/Float32` topics.

Follows the same plugin pattern as `ros2_medkit_graph_provider`: implements `GatewayPlugin` + `IntrospectionProvider` against the `get_routes()` plugin API, loaded at runtime by `ros2_medkit_gateway` via `dlopen`.

## What it does

- Connects to any OPC-UA capable PLC server over `opc.tcp`
- Emits SOVD entities (area, component, apps) from a YAML-driven node map
- Exposes PLC values as the `x-plc-data` vendor collection
- Allows writing setpoints via `x-plc-operations` with type-aware coercion and range validation
- Reports the connection state and poll metrics via `x-plc-status`
- Maps threshold-based PLC alarms to SOVD faults on the owning entity
- Optionally publishes numeric PLC values to ROS 2 `std_msgs/Float32` topics

```

The plugin connects to any PLC with an OPC-UA server over TCP. No ROS 2 dependency between the plugin and the PLC - communication is pure OPC-UA. The plugin is loaded by the gateway at runtime via `dlopen()` and registers vendor REST endpoints for PLC data access and control.

## SOVD Entity Model

The plugin creates a hierarchical entity tree from a YAML node map configuration:

```
Area: plc_systems
  └── Component: openplc_runtime
        ├── App: tank_process
        │     Data: tank_level (mm), tank_temperature (C), tank_pressure (bar)
        │     Faults: PLC_HIGH_TEMP, PLC_LOW_LEVEL, PLC_OVERPRESSURE
        ├── App: fill_pump
        │     Data: pump_speed (%)
        │     Operations: set_pump_speed
        └── App: drain_valve
              Data: valve_position (%)
              Operations: set_valve_position
```

## Asset identity (x-medkit.identity)

The plugin auto-populates the PLC component's asset-identity nameplate from the
live server and serves it as `x-medkit.identity` on the component (see
`docs/api/rest.rst` for the JSON shape). Two sources are read, best-effort:

- `Server/ServerStatus/BuildInfo` (present on every compliant server):
  `ManufacturerName`, `ProductName`, `SoftwareVersion`, `BuildNumber` (carried
  as the `extra.buildNumber` key).
- The OPC UA DI companion nameplate (`http://opcfoundation.org/UA/DI/`, only
  when the server exposes that namespace): `Manufacturer`, `Model`,
  `SerialNumber`, `HardwareRevision`, `SoftwareRevision` from the first device
  under `Objects/DeviceSet` that carries identification properties. DI values
  are device-specific and win over the server-level BuildInfo per field.

The read happens once per session - on the first introspect after a connect -
and is refreshed after every reconnect: the cached nameplate is tied to the
OPC UA session, so a PLC reboot, firmware update, or device swap is picked up
on the next discovery refresh instead of latching the first read forever.

**Trust-gated precedence.** How the live nameplate ranks against a
hand-authored manifest `identity:` block depends on whether the session
authenticates the server:

- Secured channel (`security_mode: Sign`/`SignAndEncrypt`) **and**
  `reject_untrusted: true`: the component is tagged with the protocol source
  `opcua`, which outranks `manifest` in the identity merge - an authenticated
  live read overrides stale manifest fields.
- Anything else (`SecurityPolicy=None`, or `reject_untrusted: false` /
  accept-any cert): the nameplate is spoofable by a rogue endpoint, so the
  component keeps the generic `plugin` source, which ranks below `manifest` -
  the read fills fields the operator left empty but never overrides them.

Per-field `_provenance` records `opcua` in both cases, so consumers always see
where a value was read even when it merged with low authority.

Note: identity (model, serial number, firmware/software versions) is served
unauthenticated on the default gateway configuration (`auth.enabled` defaults
to `false`) like every other discovery resource - it is a device fingerprint,
useful for reconnaissance. Enable gateway authentication (`auth.enabled: true`)
or front the API with an authenticating proxy to gate access to it.

## Finding Node IDs on your PLC

The plugin identifies PLC tags by OPC-UA node IDs in the canonical string
format (`ns=N;i=M` numeric, `ns=N;s=tag` string, `ns=N;g=...` GUID, or
`ns=N;b=...` opaque). To discover the correct node IDs for a real PLC
without guessing, use one of the standard OPC-UA browser tools:

- **UaExpert** - free GUI browser from Unified Automation. Download at
  <https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/uaexpert.html>. Connect
  to your PLC's `opc.tcp://` endpoint, navigate the address space tree,
  right-click any Variable node, copy the NodeId property into the YAML
  map below.

- **`asyncua` command line** - `pip install asyncua` and then
  `python -m asyncua.tools.uals -u opc.tcp://your-plc:4840` walks the
  address space from a terminal, no GUI required.

- **Vendor toolchains** - Siemens TIA Portal's OPC-UA configuration
  exports DB/variable node IDs in the `ns=3;s="..."` format. Beckhoff
  TwinCAT 3 XAE displays them as `ns=4;s=MAIN.Tank.level`. Allen-Bradley
  users typically deploy Kepware or Ignition as an OPC-UA gateway which
  auto-maps tag names.

`config/tank_demo_nodes.yaml` ships a commented example with
ready-to-paste templates for OpenPLC, Siemens S7-1500, Beckhoff TwinCAT,
Allen-Bradley via Kepware and KUKA KR C5. Copy one of those blocks as a
starting point.

# The three modes (`alarm`, `status_bits`, `fault_enum`) are evaluated by the
# shared `ros2_medkit_fault_detection` module so every protocol plugin maps raw
# values to faults identically. They are mutually exclusive on a single node.
#
# Status words: prefer exposing the register as an UNSIGNED OPC-UA type (Byte /
# UInt16 / UInt32 / UInt64). A signed type (Int16/Int32) whose top bit is set is
# sign-extended when widened to the 64-bit decode register, which sets every bit
# above the register width and raises spurious bit faults. When you cannot change
# the server type, set `status_word_width:` (1..64) on the node instead: the
# loader masks the raw value to that many low bits before decoding, so the
# sign-extended high bits are dropped in-config. `bit:` positions are 0-based and
# must be < 64 (and < `status_word_width` when set); higher positions are dead
# config, so the loader logs a warning and skips that bit rule while still loading
# the rest of the config.
#
# Fault codes must be globally unique across ALL fault sources - every `alarm` /
# `status_bits` / `fault_enum` entry AND every `event_alarms` entry (including
# each of its `mappings[].fault_code`) - regardless of which entity owns them. The fault manager keys and clears faults by
# fault_code alone, so a code reused on two sources (even on different entities,
# even one polled and one event-driven) would flap raise/clear or clear the other
# source's fault. The loader rejects the whole file at load with an actionable
# error naming both sources.

# Native OPC-UA AlarmConditionType events (issue #386). Subscribes to alarms
# defined inside the PLC (Siemens Program_Alarm / ProDiag, Beckhoff TF6100,

    entity_id: tank_process
    fault_code: PLC_TANK_OVERPRESSURE

  # Multi-alarm form (issue #389): one source emits many conditions (e.g. the
  # Server object as a catch-all, or one Object owning several Program_Alarms)
  # routed to distinct faults by condition identity. `mappings` are evaluated
  # in order; the first whose non-empty match fields all match the observed
  # event wins (`match_message` is a substring match, the rest equality),
  # falling back to the source-level `fault_code` (if set).
  - alarm_source: "ns=0;i=2253"          # Server object (system-wide)
    entity_id: line_1
    fault_code: PLC_GENERIC_ALARM        # catch-all fallback (optional)
    mappings:

    # Append vendor associated values (Siemens Program_Alarm SD_1..SD_n) to the
    # fault description as "label=value".
    associated_values:
      - "SD_1"
      - name: "SD_2"
        label: "Setpoint"
```

Mapping precedence: a mapping with more (non-empty) match fields is matched
only when all of them match the observed event; declaration order breaks ties.
`condition_name` / `source_node` / `event_type` are equality matches;
`match_message` is a case-sensitive substring match on the event Message.
An event matching no mapping uses the source-level `fault_code`; if that is also
empty the event is ignored. A mapping-level `severity_override` / `message`
overrides the source-level one; otherwise the source-level value is inherited.

The plugin auto-registers `acknowledge_fault` and `confirm_fault` operations
on every entity that has at least one `event_alarms` entry. Invoke them with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/apps/tank_process/operations/acknowledge_fault/executions \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"fault_code":"PLC_OVERPRESSURE","comment":"operator on radio"}'
```

See `design/index.rst` for the full state machine table and vendor matrix.

### Zero-config native A&C (`auto_alarms`)

`event_alarms:` above requires a hand-written mapping per alarm. `auto_alarms`
needs none: enable it and every AlarmConditionType event on the subscribed
source (default the Server object, `i=2253` - the same system-wide catch-all
used in the `event_alarms` examples) becomes a fault automatically, with no
`condition_name` / `source_node` / `fault_code` mapping to write.

```yaml
# Bare boolean - all defaults.
auto_alarms: true
```

```yaml
# Map form - every key optional.
auto_alarms:
  enabled: true
  source_node_id: "i=2253"       # EventNotifier to subscribe (default: Server object)
  entity_id: "plc_alarms"        # fallback SOVD entity (default: "<component_id>_alarms")
  auto_clear: true               # clear immediately on ActiveState=false, bypassing
                                  # Acknowledge/Confirm (see below)
  severity_bands:                # OPC-UA Severity (1-1000) -> SOVD bucket
    critical: 801
    error: 501
    warning: 201
  include: []                    # substring allow-list on ConditionName/SourceName/Message
  exclude: ["CPU not in RUN"]    # substring deny-list, checked first
```

Default `off`. Unknown keys are warned and ignored, not silently dropped.

**Fault derivation** (no config, per observed event):
- `fault_code`: `PLC_ALARM_<slug>` from `ConditionName` when present, else from
  `SourceName`, else `PLC_ALARM_<hash>` of SourceNode + EventType + Message.
  The hash tier folds in the Message deliberately - a real Siemens S7-1500
  multiplexes every `Program_Alarm` of one FB through a single SourceNode
  (e.g. `i=1845`) with no ConditionName/SourceName, distinguished only by
  Message text ("pa" vs "pa2"); without the Message in the hash those two
  alarms would collapse onto one fault_code.
- `entity`: the node-map entity that owns the event's SourceNode when it
  matches a `nodes:` entry, else `auto_alarms.entity_id`.
- `severity`: the event's raw `Severity` (1-1000) mapped through
  `severity_bands`.
- `description`: the event's `Message`, verbatim.

**System messages:** some servers deliver non-alarm notifications on the same
EventNotifier as real alarms - a Siemens Server object also emits SIMATIC
system messages (e.g. `"CPU not in RUN"`) over `i=2253`. Per OPC-UA Part 9
§5.5.2.13 only a true Condition instance carries a ConditionId; a system
message resolves it to `NodeId.Null`, and `auto_alarms` drops those events
before deriving a fault. Use `exclude` for anything that still needs
filtering by text (e.g. a server that does set a ConditionId on system
events).

**Precedence:** explicit `event_alarms` mappings are tried first; `auto_alarms`
covers whatever they do not match. On the same source (e.g. both configured
on `i=2253`) no duplicate subscription is created - unmatched events on an
`event_alarms` source simply fall through to auto-derivation when
`auto_alarms` is enabled for that source.

**Acknowledge/Confirm:** `auto_clear` (default `true`) clears an auto-derived
alarm as soon as it goes inactive, bypassing the Acknowledge/Confirm workflow
entirely - there is no `acknowledge_fault` SOVD operation for a zero-config
alarm to receive an Ack through, so without this it would latch forever on a
server that requires one (as most do). Set `auto_clear: false` to require
Acknowledge (via the `event_alarms` mapping path) before it clears.

### Gateway Parameters

```yaml
ros2_medkit_gateway:
  ros__parameters:
    plugins: ["opcua"]
    plugins.opcua.endpoint_url: "opc.tcp://plc-host:4840/path"
    plugins.opcua.node_map_path: "/path/to/nodes.yaml"
    plugins.opcua.poll_interval_ms: 1000
    plugins.opcua.prefer_subscriptions: false
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `endpoint_url` | `opc.tcp://localhost:4840` | OPC-UA server endpoint |
| `node_map_path` | (none) | Path to node map YAML (required) |
| `poll_interval_ms` | `1000` | Polling interval in ms (clamped to [100, 60000]) |
| `prefer_subscriptions` | `false` | Use OPC-UA subscriptions instead of polling |
| `subscription_interval_ms` | `500` | Publishing interval for OPC-UA subscriptions when `prefer_subscriptions: true` |
| `condition_replay_strategy` | `auto` | Active-condition replay on reconnect: `method`, `read`, `auto`, `off` (see below) |
| `require_confirm_for_clear` | `true` | Require both Acknowledge AND Confirm before a native alarm auto-clears. Set `false` for Confirm-less servers (e.g. Siemens S7-1500) so alarms clear on Acknowledge alone (see below) |
| `comms_lost_fault_enabled` | `true` | Raise a component-scoped `PLC_COMMS_LOST` fault when the connection stays down (issue #496) |
| `comms_lost_debounce_ms` | `5000` | Continuous down time before `PLC_COMMS_LOST` is raised (debounces reconnect blips; clamped to [0, 3600000] ms) |
| `comms_lost_severity` | `ERROR` | SOVD severity bucket for the `PLC_COMMS_LOST` fault |

### OPC-UA client security (SecurityPolicy, certificates, user auth)

By default the client connects with `SecurityPolicy=None` and an `Anonymous`
user (unencrypted, unauthenticated). This is fine for an isolated lab LAN but
not for a hardened server. The following parameters enable a signed/encrypted
SecureChannel with a client application-instance certificate, a server trust
store, and a user identity. All are opt-in; leaving them unset reproduces the
legacy behaviour.

```yaml
plugins.opcua.security_policy: "Basic256Sha256"       # None | Basic256Sha256 | Aes128Sha256RsaOaep | Aes256Sha256RsaPss
plugins.opcua.security_mode: "SignAndEncrypt"          # None | Sign | SignAndEncrypt
plugins.opcua.client_cert_path: "/etc/ros2_medkit/opcua/client_cert.der"  # X.509 v3, DER
plugins.opcua.client_key_path:  "/etc/ros2_medkit/opcua/client_key.pem"   # private key, PEM
plugins.opcua.application_uri:  "urn:selfpatch:medkit:opcua-client"        # MUST match the cert SAN URI
plugins.opcua.trust_list_paths: ["/etc/ros2_medkit/opcua/server_cert.der"]  # DER trust store
plugins.opcua.reject_untrusted: true                   # false = accept ANY server cert (INSECURE, lab only; not trust-on-first-use, nothing pinned)
plugins.opcua.user_auth_mode: "UsernamePassword"       # Anonymous | UsernamePassword | X509
plugins.opcua.username: "medkit"
plugins.opcua.password: "..."                           # inject from a secret store at deploy time
plugins.opcua.user_cert_path: "/etc/ros2_medkit/opcua/user_cert.der"  # X509 user token only
```

Notes:
- A non-None `security_policy` requires `client_cert_path` + `client_key_path`;
  a secured connection with no cert fails fast (before contacting the server).
- `application_uri` must equal the URI entry in the client certificate's
  SubjectAltName or the server rejects the channel with
  `BadCertificateUriInvalid`.
- The client cert (its public part) must be added to the server's trusted
  client list, and the server cert (DER) added to `trust_list_paths`, unless
  `reject_untrusted: false`.
- The encryption backend (OpenSSL) is compiled in; a build without it logs an
  error and refuses any secured profile.

### Active-condition replay on reconnect (issue #389/#478)

When the gateway (re)subscribes after a drop or restart, conditions that are
already active on the server would otherwise not be re-reported (only live
transitions flow). The standard recovery is OPC-UA `ConditionRefresh`. Per
Part 9 §5.5.7 it is a method of the **ConditionType** node (`i=2782`), so the
Call is issued there (not the Server object) - calling it on the Server object
was the root cause of `BadNodeIdUnknown` rejections, including on Siemens
S7-1500, which documents `ConditionRefresh` as supported (only the optional
`ConditionRefresh2` is not). With the corrected target, `ConditionRefresh` is
expected to work on conformant servers and the read fallback should rarely be
needed. The `condition_replay_strategy` parameter controls recovery:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `method` | Call `ConditionRefresh` only (warns if rejected) |
| `read` | Skip the method; browse each `alarm_source`, read current condition state, reconcile the fault set |
| `auto` (default) | Try `ConditionRefresh`; on rejection fall back to `read` |
| `off` | No replay (only live transitions surface) |

The read fallback browses each `alarm_source` for AlarmCondition instances -
both hierarchical Object children and targets of the `HasCondition` reference
(`i=9006`), recursing one level - and reads their state. It mirrors
`ConditionRefresh` semantics: only conditions with `Retain==true` form the
active set, a `Disabled` condition (`EnabledState/Id=false`) is never treated
as active, and a transient read failure keeps the condition rather than
dropping it.

**Safety guarantee (#478):** the read fallback NEVER clears a tracked fault for
a source that has not positively exposed at least one Condition instance node.
An EventNotifier-only server (e.g. S7-1500, which models no per-condition
instance nodes) makes the browse return zero conditions; rather than wiping the
active alarm set, the gateway preserves the last-known faults, logs an operator
warning that read-fallback is unsupported on this server, and keeps live
transitions flowing. Use `ConditionRefresh` (`method`/`auto`) on such servers.
The read fallback does not recover the live `EventId`, so an operator
ack/confirm may need the next live event before it succeeds.

### Confirm-less servers and `require_confirm_for_clear` (issue #478)

By default a native alarm auto-clears only after the operator has both
Acknowledged AND Confirmed it (OPC-UA Part 9 §5.7). Some servers do not
implement the optional `Confirm` transition - Siemens S7-1500 supports
`Acknowledge` / `ConditionRefresh` / `AddComment` but not `Confirm`, so
`ConfirmedState` never becomes true and an inactive alarm would latch forever.
Set `require_confirm_for_clear: false` (or `OPCUA_REQUIRE_CONFIRM_FOR_CLEAR=0`)
so the alarm clears on `Acknowledge` alone. The default (`true`) is unchanged
and spec-strict; the relaxed path still requires acknowledgement and needs
real-S7-1500 validation.

Node map entries also support an optional `ros2_topic` field to override the auto-generated ROS 2 topic name for the PLC value bridge:

```yaml
nodes:
  - node_id: "ns=2;i=1"
    entity_id: tank_process
    data_name: tank_level
    ros2_topic: /custom/plc/tank_level   # optional, overrides auto-generated /plc/tank_process/tank_level
```

### Operation Naming Convention

Write operations use the `set_` prefix convention:
- Node map defines `data_name: pump_speed`
- REST operation: `POST /apps/fill_pump/x-plc-operations/set_pump_speed`
- The `set_` prefix is stripped to find the matching node map entry
- Operations without `set_` prefix also work (matches `data_name` directly)

### Environment Variables (override YAML config)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPCUA_ENDPOINT_URL` | OPC-UA server URL |
| `OPCUA_NODE_MAP_PATH` | Path to node map YAML |
| `OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY` | `None` / `Basic256Sha256` / `Aes128Sha256RsaOaep` / `Aes256Sha256RsaPss` |
| `OPCUA_SECURITY_MODE` | `None` / `Sign` / `SignAndEncrypt` |
| `OPCUA_CLIENT_CERT` / `OPCUA_CLIENT_KEY` | Client cert (DER) / key (PEM) paths |
| `OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI` | Client application URI (must match cert SAN) |
| `OPCUA_TRUST_LIST` | Colon-separated DER trust-store paths |
| `OPCUA_REJECT_UNTRUSTED` | `false`/`0`/`no` to accept any server cert (lab only) |
| `OPCUA_USER_AUTH` | `Anonymous` / `UsernamePassword` / `X509` |
| `OPCUA_USERNAME` / `OPCUA_PASSWORD` | Username-password identity |
| `OPCUA_USER_CERT` | X.509 user-token cert (DER) |
| `OPCUA_CONDITION_REPLAY` | `method` / `read` / `auto` / `off` |
| `OPCUA_REQUIRE_CONFIRM_FOR_CLEAR` | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to clear native alarms on Acknowledge alone (Confirm-less servers) |
| `OPCUA_COMMS_LOST_ENABLED` | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to disable the `PLC_COMMS_LOST` fault |
| `OPCUA_COMMS_LOST_DEBOUNCE_MS` | Continuous down time (ms) before `PLC_COMMS_LOST` is raised (clamped to [0, 3600000] ms; non-numeric / out-of-range keeps the existing value) |

Plugin runs on the robot itself. ROS 2 faults and PLC alarms appear side by side.

### Compatible PLCs

Any PLC with an OPC-UA server works out of the box:

| PLC | OPC-UA Support | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| Siemens S7-1500 | Built-in | Most common in EU industry |
| Allen-Bradley CompactLogix | Built-in | Common in US |
| Beckhoff TwinCAT | Built-in | Popular in motion control |
| Schneider M340/M580 | Built-in | Process automation |
| OpenPLC v4 | Plugin (asyncua) | Open-source, used in our demo |
| Older PLCs (S7-300, etc.) | Via Modbus->OPC-UA bridge | Requires additional software |

### What you need

1. PLC with OPC-UA server enabled (most modern PLCs have this)
2. Network connectivity between robot/edge device and PLC (Ethernet, same subnet)
3. Node map YAML matching your PLC program variables
4. See Security Limitations below regarding OPC-UA auth

### What you DON'T need

- No ROS 2 on the PLC
- No modification to the PLC program
- No special hardware adapters
- No proprietary PLC software licenses

## Development

### Build

```bash
# From ros2_medkit repo root
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select ros2_medkit_opcua
colcon test --packages-select ros2_medkit_opcua
```

### Docker Integration Tests

The plugin ships a self-contained OpenPLC tank demo in `docker/` that exercises the full stack end-to-end. CI runs this suite on every PR that touches the plugin; it is also runnable locally from any developer laptop.

```bash
cd src/ros2_medkit_plugins/ros2_medkit_opcua/docker

# Start OpenPLC + gateway (builds everything)
bash scripts/start.sh

# Manual testing
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/apps/tank_process/x-plc-data | jq .

# Automated tests (16 assertions)
bash scripts/run_integration_tests.sh

# Stop
bash scripts/stop.sh
```

### Test Coverage

| Category | Tests | What it validates |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Entity discovery | 5 | Areas, components, apps from PLC node map |
| PLC connection | 2 | OPC-UA connected, zero errors |
| Live data | 3 | Tank level, temperature, pressure have values |
| Write control | 2 | Pump speed, valve position written to PLC |
| Error handling | 3 | Unknown entity, unknown operation, invalid JSON |
| **Total** | **16** | |

## Security

The client supports a signed/encrypted SecureChannel (`SecurityPolicy`
Basic256Sha256 / Aes128 / Aes256, `MessageSecurityMode` Sign / SignAndEncrypt),
a client application-instance certificate, a server trust store with
reject-untrusted, and user identity (Anonymous / Username-Password / X.509).
See "OPC-UA client security" above for configuration.

**The default remains `SecurityPolicy=None` + `Anonymous` (unencrypted,
unauthenticated)** for backward compatibility and isolated-LAN demos; enable a
secured profile for any network exposed to untrusted traffic. The plugin logs
the effective security profile at startup and warns when running unsecured or
with `reject_untrusted: false`.

Northbound (gateway REST) hardening is documented separately in the gateway's
`design/hardening.rst` and the `gateway_params.secure.yaml` field profile.

Write operations include configurable `min_value`/`max_value` range validation to prevent out-of-range values being sent to PLC actuators.

## Alarm-to-Fault Bridge

PLC alarms (threshold-based) are automatically mapped to SOVD faults:

```
PLC variable (e.g., TankTemperature = 95C)
    │
    ▼  threshold check (> 80C)
Alarm active: PLC_HIGH_TEMP
    │
    ▼  ROS 2 service call
ros2_medkit fault_manager
    │
    ▼  appears in SOVD API
GET /api/v1/apps/tank_process/faults
  -> [{fault_code: "PLC_HIGH_TEMP", severity: "ERROR", ...}]
```

When the value returns below threshold, the fault is automatically cleared.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Poll mode by default** - OPC-UA subscriptions require a client event loop thread. Polling at 1s interval is simpler and sufficient for diagnostics use cases.
- **Type-aware writes** - Plugin reads the OPC-UA node's data type before writing to avoid type mismatches (e.g., writing float32 to a REAL node, not float64).
- **Node map driven** - All entity mapping is in YAML config, not code. Same plugin binary works with any PLC by changing the config file.
- **Env var overrides** - `OPCUA_ENDPOINT_URL` and `OPCUA_NODE_MAP_PATH` override YAML config for Docker deployment flexibility.
