ros2_medkit_cmake
==================

This section contains design documentation for the ros2_medkit_cmake package.

Overview
--------

The ``ros2_medkit_cmake`` package is a build utility package that provides shared CMake
modules for all other ros2_medkit packages. It contains no runtime code - only CMake
macros and functions that are sourced via ``find_package(ros2_medkit_cmake REQUIRED)``
and ``include()``.

Modules
-------

The package provides these CMake modules, installed to the ament index:

1. **ros2_medkit_cmake-extras.cmake** - Ament extras hook

   - Automatically sourced after ``find_package(ros2_medkit_cmake)``
   - Appends the installed module directory to ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``
   - Enables transparent ``include(ROS2MedkitCcache)`` etc. in downstream packages

2. **ROS2MedkitCcache.cmake** - Compiler cache integration

   - Auto-detects ``ccache`` on the system
   - Sets ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`` and ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER``
   - Respects existing launcher overrides (does not clobber explicit settings)
   - Must be included early in CMakeLists.txt, before ``add_library``/``add_executable``

3. **ROS2MedkitLinting.cmake** - Shared lint configuration

   - Provides ``medkit_lint_config(<file name> <output variable>)``, which every
     package uses to address ``.clang-format``, ``.clang-tidy`` and ``.flake8``
   - Provides ``ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY`` option (default OFF; a local gate only, CI
     configures it OFF and runs ``run-clang-tidy`` over the compilation database)
   - Provides ``ros2_medkit_clang_tidy()`` function with optional ``HEADER_FILTER``,
     ``TIMEOUT`` and ``JOBS`` arguments
   - Provides ``ROS2_MEDKIT_CLANG_TIDY_JOBS`` (default ``min(host cores, 2)``),
     capped so one package fits an 8 GB machine; memory scales linearly at
     roughly 1.2 GiB per job. Switch it with ``./scripts/test.sh tidy --jobs <n>``

Where the lint configs live
---------------------------

The three shared configs are files of this package, kept in ``cmake/`` next to
the modules and installed next to them, so ``medkit_lint_config()`` resolves
them at the same relative path from a source tree, a plain install and a
``--symlink-install``. The repository root paths - ``.clang-format``,
``.clang-tidy`` and ``.flake8`` - are symlinks to these files, which is what
editors, ``pre-commit`` and ``scripts/clang-tidy-diff.sh`` address. There is one
copy of each and nothing to keep in sync.

The alternative a package reaches for first, ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../..``,
resolves in a workspace checkout and in no other tree. A binary package is built
from an export of one package directory with nothing above it, so the linter is
handed a path that does not exist and fails on every such build - invisibly,
because bloom's ``debian/rules`` runs the test step as ``dh_auto_test || true``.
``medkit_lint_config()`` aborts the configure step when a config is missing
rather than running the linter unconfigured or skipping it, and
``test_lint_config`` holds the whole arrangement in place, including a sweep for
new packages reintroducing the escape.

4. **ROS2MedkitCompat.cmake** - Multi-distro compatibility layer

   - ``medkit_find_yaml_cpp()`` - Resolves yaml-cpp across Humble (no cmake target) and Jazzy (namespaced target)
   - ``medkit_find_cpp_httplib()`` - Finds cpp-httplib >= 0.14 via pkg-config, cmake config, or vendored fallback (``VENDORED_DIR`` param)
   - ``medkit_detect_compat_defs()`` - Detects rclcpp and rosbag2 versions, sets ``MEDKIT_RCLCPP_VERSION_MAJOR`` and ``MEDKIT_ROSBAG2_OLD_TIMESTAMP``
   - ``medkit_apply_compat_defs(target)`` - Applies compile definitions based on detected versions
   - ``medkit_target_dependencies(target ...)`` - Drop-in replacement for ``ament_target_dependencies`` that also works on Lyrical (where ``ament_target_dependencies`` was removed)

5. **ROS2MedkitTestDomain.cmake** - ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` allocation for tests, and the
   system-package launch-test guard

   - ``medkit_add_gtest()``, ``medkit_add_gmock()`` and ``medkit_add_pytest_test()``
     register a test behind the domain wrapper unconditionally, so a test cannot be
     added without isolation
   - ``medkit_add_launch_test()`` does the same, but conditionally:
     ``_medkit_launch_tests_can_register()`` registers nothing at all when the configure
     looks like the ROS build farm's binarydeb job - the install prefix matches
     ``/opt/ros/<anything>`` AND ``CMAKE_INSTALL_LOCALSTATEDIR`` is the absolute path
     ``/var``, both read from CMake variables, never from the environment. That job runs
     its test step before its own install step, so a launch test cannot resolve the
     package under test through the ament index and fails on that alone, on every launch
     test, for every package, on Humble (the only distro whose binarydeb job still runs
     package tests at all). gtests and pytest tests need no installed prefix and are
     unaffected. See "The One Case That Cannot Live Here, Reconciled With the Guard"
     below.
   - ``medkit_add_wrapped_test(<name> COMMAND <cmd...>)`` does the same as the
     unconditional three, for a test that builds its own command line
   - ``DOMAINS <n>`` on any of them for a test that holds several domains at once; the
     extras arrive as ``MEDKIT_SECONDARY_DOMAINS``
   - ``medkit_test_needs_no_domain(<test>)`` declares a test ROS-free
   - the domain-allocation runtime guard described below (``test_dds_domain_allocation``)
     registers itself in every package; no package calls anything to get it - a separate
     mechanism from the launch-test guard above, which acts at configure time instead of
     at test run time
   - the wrapper scripts themselves live in ``scripts/``: ``medkit_domain.py`` (the band
     and the allocator), ``medkit_domain_runner.py`` (ament test runner replacement),
     ``medkit_run_with_domain.py`` (generic command wrapper)

Design Decisions
----------------

Test Domains Avoid the Ephemeral Port Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTPS gives a DDS domain the UDP slice ``[7400 + 250 * d, 7400 + 250 * d + 249]``, and both
CycloneDDS and Fast-DDS bind inside it without an effective ``SO_REUSEPORT`` exemption. The
Linux kernel hands out ephemeral ports from ``net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range``, 32768-60999 by
default, which maps back to domains 101-214. A domain in that band works until an unrelated
process on the machine is given one of its ports first, and then every node on it fails to
start with ``failed to bind to ANY:<port>: address in use``.

Test domains are therefore drawn only from 1-100 and 215-231, 117 in all. Domain 0 is left
to the developer shell, and 232 is dropped because its slice runs past 65535. The derivation
per DDS implementation is written out at the top of ``scripts/medkit_domain.py``, next to the
tuple it justifies.

The Band Is Checked Against the Kernel It Was Derived From
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That derivation holds for a machine whose ``net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`` is the Linux
default, and the range is a sysctl. ``1024 65535`` is a common hardening and scaling setting
and puts every domain in the band inside the range the kernel may hand to anything: 45% of
all ephemeral ports then land in a slice the band calls safe. ``10240 65535``, common on
Kubernetes nodes, leaves only domains 1-10. A constant that is silently wrong on such a
machine produces bind failures in unrelated tests, which is the failure this whole scheme
exists to remove.

``verify_band`` therefore reads the live range and refuses to hand out a domain the band
cannot justify on THIS machine. Three properties make it worth having:

* It runs where the tests run. In CI the machine that builds is not the machine that tests,
  so a configure-time check would be reading the wrong kernel.
* It refuses rather than downgrades. A run quietly narrowed to ten domains under
  ``ctest -j`` would look like flaky timeouts, not like a misconfigured host. The refusal
  names the sysctl, and names the subset that is still safe so it can be taken deliberately
  through ``MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAIN_BAND``.
* It never guesses. ``MEDKIT_TEST_EPHEMERAL_PORT_RANGE`` declares the range for a machine
  where ``/proc/sys`` is not visible at all, and is merged to the widest of the two when the
  file can also be read, so a declaration can only make the check stricter. A machine that
  answers neither way is refused, because assuming the default there is precisely the
  assumption the check exists to stop.

Only reading is needed, and only reading is possible: ``/proc/sys`` is mounted read-only
inside a container, so the check sees the host's setting and can never quietly "fix" it.

Several Domains at Once, or None
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A multi-gateway test asks for several domains with ``DOMAINS <n>``. Taking them one at a
time and keeping each while waiting for the next is a deadlock waiting for a second such
test: two tests wanting four domains each can end up holding two apiece, neither able to
finish and neither giving anything back until both wait budgets run out. The integration
suite has two ``DOMAINS 4`` tests, so this is a pairing ``ctest -j`` can actually produce.

Acquisition is therefore all-or-nothing. ``hold_domains`` takes the whole set or releases
everything it managed to take, and holds nothing at all while it waits. That trades a
permanent deadlock for a livelock window, which is bounded and is paid for twice: every
attempt uses a freshly randomised selector start, and the wait between attempts is jittered,
so two callers of the same size do not keep taking and releasing in step.

The Allocation Happens at Run Time, Not at Configure Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A test takes a domain when it starts and holds it, through an open TCP socket on
``32768 + domain``, for exactly as long as it runs. The lock is
``domain_coordinator.domain_id`` from ``ament_cmake_ros``, which ships on every distro the
project builds for, so this adds no dependency. Release is the kernel closing the socket,
which covers a crash and a ``SIGKILL`` as well as an ordinary exit.

This replaced a hand-written table of per-package domain pools. The table worked, but it had
to be edited every time a package grew past its pool, and the pools had to stay pairwise
disjoint because colcon runs a separate ``ctest`` per package and a CTest ``RESOURCE_LOCK``
only binds inside one ``ctest`` run. An OS-level lock has no such boundary: two processes
contending for a port do not care which ``ctest`` started them, so both the table and the
disjointness requirement went away with it.

The band is smaller than the number of tests the workspace can have in flight under
``ctest -j $(nproc)`` across parallel packages. A test that finds every domain held waits for
one, bounded by ``MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAIN_WAIT`` (180 s by default), and fails loudly if the wait
runs out. It never falls back to a literal, and never to domain 0 - a test on domain 0 does
not fail, it silently sees every node on the machine.

Upstream ``ament_add_ros_isolated_gtest`` is deliberately not used. It draws from
``domain_coordinator``'s own 1-100 selector, which does not include the 215-231 range, and it
skips allocation entirely when ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` is already set in the environment - which
would collapse a whole run onto one domain the moment a developer or a colcon extension
exported one. The same reasoning rules out ``colcon-ros-domain-id-coordinator``, which
allocates one domain per package task and pre-sets ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID``.

Shared Memory Is Reclaimed Before the Domain Is Released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Fast DDS participant killed by a signal never frees its shared-memory segments and ports.
Tests kill participants on purpose (peer failure, recovery), and ``/dev/shm`` is 64 MB in a
default container, so the leftovers accumulate until an unrelated test fails for lack of
space.

Both wrappers therefore run ``fastdds shm clean`` when the test command returns, before the
domain is released, and print one line when it removed anything. The tool removes a file only
when no process holds its lock, so segments of tests still running elsewhere stay. It runs for
every test, whatever RMW the test used, and is skipped when ``fastdds`` is not installed. It never
changes the test's exit code.

The check is a non-blocking ``flock``. A participant that is creating a segment at that
moment has a short window before it takes its lock; that window is accepted, because the
alternative, sweeping only when no ROS process runs on the machine, never sweeps on a shared
development box. ``scripts/sweep_shm.sh`` keeps that stricter rule for a manual sweep.

The Constraint Is Checked, Not Documented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The failure mode is silence: a test registered with plain ``ament_add_gtest`` or
``add_launch_test`` still passes, it just runs on the default domain and shares it with
everything else on the machine. Nothing at configure time can see this, because the command
is assembled by ament and a later ``set_tests_properties`` can drop what was appended to it.

``test_dds_domain_allocation`` therefore runs on the machine that executes the tests. It
reads the generated CTest properties back and fails on any test whose command does not go
through a wrapper script, unless that test is a linter or carries the ``no_ros_domain`` label
written by ``medkit_test_needs_no_domain()``. It also prints the ephemeral range it read and
fails when the band does not hold against it: the allocator refuses per test and mid-run,
whereas the gate says it once, before the run, in the words of the sysctl that has to change.

One limit is worth writing down, because it is inherited rather than chosen. The lock is a
TCP bind, so its reach is one network namespace, not one machine. Two containers on the same
host each have their own namespace and can both hold ``32768 + 47``, yet DDS multicast
crosses Docker's default bridge, so nodes in those two containers do see each other. Isolating
containers on a shared bridge is not something this scheme provides, and the same is true of
upstream's ``ament_add_ros_isolated_gtest``, which uses the same lock.

The wait budget is derived rather than fixed. ``ament_add_test`` defaults to ``TIMEOUT 60``,
so an allocator waiting a fixed 180 seconds was killed by CTest mid-wait on nearly every test
in the tree and the message explaining that no domain could be had never printed. The CMake
helpers now set ``MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAIN_WAIT`` to half of each test's own ``TIMEOUT``, read at
the end of the directory so that a ``set_tests_properties`` raising the timeout after
registration is picked up, and ``test_dds_domain_allocation`` fails any wrapped test whose
budget does not fit inside its timeout.

Neither gate is opt-in, and that is deliberate. An earlier shape had each package call
``medkit_add_domain_allocation_test()``; four packages never did, and their fourteen tests
ran on domain 0 with nothing to say so. A gate that only runs where somebody remembered to
register it reproduces exactly the maintenance burden this change exists to remove. So
``test_dds_domain_allocation`` is armed from ``ros2_medkit_cmake-extras.cmake``, the file
ament sources on ``find_package(ros2_medkit_cmake)``, which every package already calls. The
registration is deferred with ``cmake_language(DEFER)`` because the hook fires before a
package's tests exist and, in several packages, before ``BUILD_TESTING`` is defined.

That still leaves a package that never finds ``ros2_medkit_cmake`` at all, so
``test_dds_domain_coverage`` sweeps every package build directory in the workspace, applies
the same per-test rule to all of them, and separately reports a package that has tests but
no gate. Between the two, a newly added package is covered whether or not its author knows
the scheme exists.

The wrapper itself is covered by this package's own suite, which pins the band and its
endpoints, an unrelated process holding a lock port, an exhausted band, excess holders
waiting and being served as domains free up, a holder killed with ``SIGKILL`` releasing its
domain, the band checked against a non-default ephemeral range rather than against a
description of one, and two concurrent multi-domain callers that both have to finish.
The cross-talk probe carries its control: two independently allocated ROS nodes must hear
nothing from each other, and the same two forced onto one domain must hear each other,
because a zero from an instrument that cannot register a one means nothing. It starts both
peers itself, as concurrent subprocesses it joins, and fails if they did not overlap. An
earlier shape registered them as two CTest tests and needed ``ctest -j`` to run them side by
side; CTest cannot be asked for that, so the pair passed under a parallel run and failed
under a serial one. Concurrency a test depends on is the test's to arrange.

The One Case That Cannot Live Here, Reconciled With the Guard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The one case that cannot live here is a real launch test of this package's own, which would
prove a launch test's children join its domain. ``launch_testing_ament_cmake`` reaches the
deprecated ``FindPythonLibs`` through ``python_cmake_module`` on Humble, and this project is
declared ``NONE``: with no language enabled CMake leaves ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` and
``CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P`` empty, so ``find_library`` never searches the multiarch directory and
libpython is not found however the development headers are installed. Since every package
depends on this one, a configure failure here stops the whole workspace, so that test lives
in ``ros2_medkit_fault_reporter``, which compiles and already runs a launch test on every
distro. Keep a real launch test of this package's own - one that would make ``project(
ros2_medkit_cmake NONE)`` itself resolve ``launch_testing_ament_cmake`` - out of this package.

That does not rule out ``find_package(launch_testing_ament_cmake)`` appearing here at all.
``test/test_launch_test_guard.py`` proves the guard described above against a real ``cmake``
configure by writing a throwaway ``CMakeLists.txt`` per case and running a separate ``cmake
-S ... -B ...`` subprocess against it - every probe that needs it declares its own
``project(... C)`` or ``project(... CXX)``, never ``NONE``, so the hazard above does not
apply: it is the throwaway subprocess's own language that ``find_package`` and
``find_library`` see, not this package's. ``ros2_medkit_cmake/CMakeLists.txt`` itself is
still ``project(ros2_medkit_cmake NONE)`` and still never calls
``find_package(launch_testing_ament_cmake)``; the package declares it a ``test_depend`` in
``package.xml`` so the probes that do call it resolve on their own merits rather than by
happening to ride in on some other package's dependency chain. What stays out of this package
is a real launch test of its own; a subprocess that configures one, with a language of its
own, is a different thing and always was.

Separate Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shared CMake modules live in their own ament package rather than being inlined
into each consuming package. This avoids duplication and ensures all packages
use the same compatibility logic. Downstream packages declare
``<buildtool_depend>ros2_medkit_cmake</buildtool_depend>`` in their
``package.xml``.

Multi-Distro Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than maintaining separate branches per ROS 2 distribution, the compat
module detects version numbers at configure time and adapts. This keeps a single
source tree building on Humble, Jazzy, and Lyrical without ``#ifdef`` proliferation
in application code.
