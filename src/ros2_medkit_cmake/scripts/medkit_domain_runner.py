"""The ament test runner, with a DDS domain held around it.

``ament_add_test`` invokes ``python -u <RUNNER> <result file> ...``, so this
script takes the arguments ``run_test.py`` takes and hands them straight on. It
runs in place of ``run_test.py`` rather than in front of it: the domain is held
by the process that already supervises the test command, so no process is added
to the tree and nothing new can orphan a test on a CTest timeout.

How many domains the test needs comes from ``MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAINS`` in the test's
CTest environment, set by the helpers in ``ROS2MedkitTestDomain.cmake``.

This is deliberately not ``ament_add_ros_isolated_gtest``'s runner. That one
draws from upstream's 1-100 selector, and it skips allocation entirely when
``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` is already set in the environment - which would put every test
of a run onto one domain the moment a developer or a colcon extension exported
one. Here an inherited ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` is replaced, always.

    run_test.py writes one of these as its very first action, precisely so that
    a command which segfaults or is killed still leaves a visible failure. That
    guarantee only starts once run_test.py is running, and this wrapper does
    work before then: reading the domain count, waiting for a domain. A failure
    in that window used to leave no result file at all, which reads as an absent
    test rather than a failed one - a test that has stopped proving anything
    while still looking present.
