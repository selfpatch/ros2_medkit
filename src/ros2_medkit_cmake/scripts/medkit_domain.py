"""Runtime ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` allocation for tests.

A test asks for one or more domains when it starts and holds them, through an
open socket, for exactly as long as it runs. The kernel closes that socket when
the holder dies for any reason, including SIGKILL, so a domain is never leaked
by a crashed run.

The lock is ``domain_coordinator.domain_id`` from ``ament_cmake_ros``, which is
installed on every distro we build for. It binds a TCP socket on
``32768 + domain`` and holds it for the lifetime of its context. That socket is
what carries the allocation past a single CTest run: two ``ctest`` processes
started by two different ``colcon`` package jobs contend for the same ports,
which no CTest ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` can do.

The reach of that lock is one NETWORK NAMESPACE, not one machine, and the
difference matters. Two containers on the same host each get their own
namespace, so each can bind ``32768 + 47`` and believe it holds domain 47 - yet
DDS multicast crosses Docker's default bridge, so nodes in those two containers
do see each other. Domain isolation between containers on a shared bridge is
therefore not something this scheme provides. Inherited from
``domain_coordinator`` and true of upstream's ``ament_add_ros_isolated_gtest``
in the same way, so it is a limit to know about rather than a bug to fix here:
isolate containers at the network, or give them separate ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID``
ranges, if they must not meet.

Three things here are ours rather than upstream's:

* the band, see ``USABLE_DOMAINS`` below, and the run-time check that the band
  is actually safe on the machine the tests run on, see ``verify_band``;
* waiting. ``domain_id`` raises as soon as it has tried its selector 100 times,
  which under ``ctest -j`` simply means "everything is busy right now". A test
  that cannot have a domain yet has to wait for one, with a bound, not fail.
* all-or-nothing acquisition for a test that needs several domains, see
  ``hold_domains``.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why the band is not simply 1-232
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

RTPS gives every DDS domain a 250-port slice of the UDP space:

  slice(d) = [7400 + 250 * d, 7400 + 250 * d + 249]

Cyclone DDS 0.10.5, what both Humble and Jazzy ship, binds the multicast
sockets at offsets 0 and 1 unconditionally, on every configuration -
ddsi_portmapping.c forces the participant index to 0 for both multicast cases,
so the index never enters into it. Those sockets do set both SO_REUSEPORT and
SO_REUSEADDR, but a collision there is still fatal: Linux only grants the reuse
exemption when every socket that ever held the port opted in, so an ordinary
socket already sitting on it blocks the bind regardless. A failed multicast bind
aborts domain creation, so this is the failure that actually kills a node:

  ddsi_udp_create_conn: failed to bind to ANY:53150: address in use
  rmw_create_node: failed to create domain, error Error

53150 is 7400 + 250 * 183, the multicast base port of domain 183 - the failure
above is exactly the case this band protects against.

The unicast sockets, at offsets 10 + 2p and 11 + 2p for participant index p,
depend on Discovery/ParticipantIndex. On Humble, rmw_cyclonedds_cpp emits no
<Discovery> element, so the default "none" applies and the single unicast socket
gets a kernel-assigned port with no relation to the domain. On Jazzy,
rmw_cyclonedds_cpp injects <ParticipantIndex>auto</ParticipantIndex> with
MaxAutoParticipantIndex 32, so unicast does land on offsets 10 through 75 - but
a collision there is not fatal, it just advances to the next participant index.

Fast DDS 3.6.2 (Lyrical) derives every listening port from the formula and never
falls back to a kernel-assigned one; its participant id mutates by +2 for up to
100 tries on collision. A failed multicast bind there is only a warning, so
discovery degrades instead of the process dying.

What keeping a domain's slice out of the ephemeral range buys, then: on every
distro it protects offsets 0 and 1, the one collision that is fatal. On Jazzy it
additionally covers offsets 10 through 75. On Humble the unicast socket sits
outside the scheme entirely and needs no protection, since a kernel-assigned
port is free by construction.

The protection is deterministic rather than statistical: once a socket with the
reuse options holds a port, the kernel will not also hand that port out as an
ephemeral one. The race runs one way - the unrelated process has to grab the
port before the participant starts, never the other way around.

The kernel hands out ephemeral ports from net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range, which
defaults to 32768-60999. Any unrelated process - a browser, a package manager, a
second test run - can be given a port in that range, and if it is one of ours
the whole domain stops working. Mapped back through the formula, the default
range covers domains 101 to 214: domain 101's slice, 32650-32899, already
overlaps the range starting at 32768.

The usable domains are the ones whose whole slice sits outside that range: 1-100
and 215-231. Domain 0 stays free because it is the ROS 2 default a developer
shell uses, and 232 is dropped because its slice runs past 65535. Upstream's
``domain_coordinator`` selector uses 1-100 only; the extra 17 are ours and are
the reason a selector is passed in at all.

That derivation is only true for a machine whose range is the default one, and
the range is a sysctl any operator, image or Kubernetes node can change. With
``net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`` set to ``1024 65535``, which is a common
hardening and scaling setting, every domain in the band above is inside it and
45% of all ephemeral ports land in a slice the band calls safe. So the band is
not taken on trust: ``verify_band`` reads the live range on the machine that
RUNS the tests, at the moment a test asks for a domain, and refuses to hand one
out when the band does not hold there. Reading is enough, and reading is all
that is possible: ``/proc/sys`` is mounted read-only inside a container, so the
check can see the host's setting but can never quietly "fix" it. A machine where
the file cannot be read at all is refused rather than assumed to be a default
one, since that assumption is exactly the thing the check exists to stop making.
