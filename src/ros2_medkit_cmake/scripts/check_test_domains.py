"""Catch a test that never goes through the DDS domain wrapper.

Domains are allocated at run time now, by a wrapper that sits in the test's
command line. A test registered without it does not fail - it runs on the ROS 2
default domain 0, where it sees every node on the machine and every node on the
machine sees it. That is a silent failure, so it needs a gate.

This runs on the machine that TESTS, against the CTest properties CMake actually
generated, which is the only place the truth is visible: the wrapper is part of
the command, and no configure-time check can tell whether a later
``set_tests_properties`` dropped the count that goes with it.

A test passes when any of these holds:

* its command goes through one of the wrapper scripts and it carries
  ``MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAINS`` >= 1
* it carries the ``no_ros_domain`` label, the explicit statement written by
  ``medkit_test_needs_no_domain()`` that it creates no ROS entities at all
* it is a linter, which runs no ROS code and is registered by ament, not by us

Two modes, because one package cannot see the hole the other half covers:

``--build-dir``
    One package, registered automatically for every package that finds
    ros2_medkit_cmake (see its extras hook).

``--workspace-build-dir``
    Every package build directory in the workspace, including packages that
    never found ros2_medkit_cmake and therefore carry no per-package guard.
    Those are reported by name: a package with tests and no guard is how a
    package leaves the scheme, and it is the case a per-package gate can never
    see.
