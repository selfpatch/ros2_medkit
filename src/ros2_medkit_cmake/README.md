# ros2_medkit_cmake

Shared CMake modules for the ros2_medkit workspace. Provides multi-distro compatibility,
build acceleration, and centralized linting configuration across all packages.

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ROS2MedkitCcache.cmake` | Auto-detect and configure ccache with PCH-aware sloppiness settings |
| `ROS2MedkitCompat.cmake` | Multi-distro compatibility shims for ROS 2 Humble, Jazzy, and Lyrical |
| `ROS2MedkitCoverage.cmake` | gcov/lcov instrumentation behind `-DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON` |
| `ROS2MedkitLinting.cmake` | Centralized clang-tidy configuration (opt-in local gate; CI runs `run-clang-tidy` instead) |
| `ROS2MedkitSanitizers.cmake` | ASan / TSan / UBSan behind `-DSANITIZER=asan,ubsan` |
| `ROS2MedkitTestDomain.cmake` | Per-package `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` allocation for test isolation |
| `ROS2MedkitWarnings.cmake` | Shared warning flags and vendored-code relaxations |

### ROS2MedkitCompat

Resolves dependency differences across ROS 2 distributions:

- `medkit_find_yaml_cpp()` - Finds yaml-cpp (namespaced targets on Jazzy, manual fallback on Humble)
- `medkit_find_cpp_httplib()` - Finds cpp-httplib >= 0.14 via pkg-config, CMake config, or vendored fallback (`VENDORED_DIR` param)
- `medkit_target_dependencies()` - Drop-in replacement for `ament_target_dependencies` (removed on Lyrical)
- `medkit_detect_compat_defs()` / `medkit_apply_compat_defs()` - Compile definitions for version-specific APIs

### ROS2MedkitLinting

Registers the package's `clang_tidy` CTest test behind `-DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON`,
off by default. This is a local gate: CI does not use it. The `clang-tidy` job
in `.github/workflows/quality.yml` configures with `-DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF` and
runs `run-clang-tidy` over the compilation database instead.

A participating package registers exactly one such test - packages that exclude
`ament_cmake_clang_tidy` and never call `ros2_medkit_clang_tidy()` register none.
colcon runs a separate `ctest` per package, so `--ctest-args -j` has nothing to
parallelise: CTest only ever sees one matching test. The analysis is therefore
parallelised **inside** the test:

- `-DROS2_MEDKIT_CLANG_TIDY_JOBS=<n>` at configure time sets how many
  `clang-tidy` processes one package runs. It defaults to `min(host cores, 2)`,
  falling back to 1 where CMake cannot determine the core count.
- `ros2_medkit_clang_tidy(JOBS <n>)` overrides it for a single package.
- `./scripts/test.sh tidy --jobs <n>` is the everyday switch. The count is baked
  into the CTest command at configure time, so the script reconfigures the
  clang-tidy packages first - a couple of seconds, no recompilation. The value
  then sticks in the CMake cache, so every `tidy` run prints the count in
  effect.

How many packages analyse at once is colcon's `--parallel-workers`, not
CTest's `-j`. Because the parallelism now lives inside each test, the package
tests must run one at a time: `./scripts/test.sh tidy` pins
`--parallel-workers 1` and ignores a caller's override, because running both
levels at once multiplies peak memory by the number of packages.

The footprint is large enough that the default is capped rather than set to the
core count. Measured on `ros2_medkit_gateway`, a 16-core host:

| `JOBS`        | wall clock | peak resident |
|---------------|-----------:|--------------:|
| 2 *(default)* |   17min58s |       2.6 GiB |
| 4             |    9min55s |       4.7 GiB |
| 8             |    6min00s |       9.4 GiB |
| 16            |    4min32s |      17.4 GiB |

Memory scales linearly at roughly 1.2 GiB per job - a single `clang-tidy`
process holds 1.4 GiB at its peak - while wall clock does not. The default is
sized so that one package fits an 8 GB machine, which puts it at 2. That is
deliberately the slow end of the curve: the alternative is a default that only
works on the largest machine anyone here has.

If you have the memory, take it - `./scripts/test.sh tidy --jobs 8` roughly
triples the speed for 9.4 GiB.

Over-subscribing is guarded, but only through the script. `ament_clang_tidy`
derives its exit status from the warnings it managed to parse, so a `clang-tidy`
process killed by the OOM reaper contributes nothing and the test passes as if
the package were clean. `./scripts/test.sh tidy` scans the per-test logs for the
`failed with error code` marker and fails the run instead, naming the packages
that lost coverage. A bare `colcon test -R clang_tidy` has no such guard.

### ROS2MedkitCoverage

Adds `--coverage -O0 -g` when built with `-DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON`, and is a no-op
otherwise. The flags are applied at directory scope, so every target declared
after the `include()` is instrumented - libraries, executables and test binaries
alike.

Every package that compiles production C++ must include this module, and must
include it **before its first target**. Packages that compile only test
scaffolding are exempt; they are listed in `EXCLUDED_PACKAGES` in the gate
script, each with a reason.

Skipping it does not break the build: the package emits no `.gcda`, lcov never
sees it, and it silently leaves both the numerator and the denominator of the
reported coverage percentage. `scripts/check_coverage_packages.sh` guards
against that, deriving the packages that must appear from the source tree rather
than from this include. It runs `--static-only` in the Quality workflow and
against the generated report in the CI coverage job.

The gate checks that the include is present, not where it sits, because no
reliable line-based check survives legal CMake (targets inside `function()`
bodies, `if(FALSE)` blocks, `INTERFACE` libraries that compile nothing). An
include placed after a target still shows up whenever it costs the package all
of its records; a partial slip does not. Put it above the first target.

### ROS2MedkitSanitizers

A no-op unless `-DSANITIZER=` names at least one of `asan`, `tsan`, `ubsan`
(comma-separated; `asan` and `tsan` cannot be combined). When it is active it
overrides three things the build type would otherwise decide, and it does so
through `add_compile_options`, which CMake places after
`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` on the command line:

- `-O1` instead of the build type's level. Sanitizers report fewer false
  positives and run faster here than at `-O0`.
- `-g1`: line tables plus descriptions of functions and external variables, but
  no locals and no types. Before this was set, full DWARF took the instrumented
  ASan tree to about 27 GB, most of it debug info, which is written by the
  compiler, read by the linker and stored in ccache. A sanitizer report still
  names `file:line`, and still names the overflowed variable, because that name
  comes from the frame descriptor ASan embeds rather than from DWARF. What is
  lost is inspecting locals in a debugger on a core file.
- `-UNDEBUG`, so `assert()` stays live. `Release` and `RelWithDebInfo` both
  carry `-DNDEBUG`, and the CI sanitizer jobs build `RelWithDebInfo`, so
  without this the one build meant to abort on a broken invariant was the one
  compiling every assert away. Note how wide this reaches: the flag is
  directory-scoped like the others, so it enables assertions in everything
  compiled into a participating package, not only the handful the repository
  writes itself. `nlohmann/json` routes its `JSON_ASSERT` to `assert`, and the
  vendored `cpp-httplib` and `dynmsg` carry their own. Those checks firing is
  the intended behaviour of a sanitizer build, but it does mean a latent bug in
  a header shows up as an abort in the sanitizer jobs and nowhere else.

Do not move these into `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`, where the build type's flags would
come last and win instead.

### ROS2MedkitTestDomain

Gives every test a `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` of its own, allocated when the test starts and held for
exactly as long as the test runs.

```cmake
include(ROS2MedkitTestDomain)

medkit_add_gtest(test_foo test/test_foo.cpp)
medkit_add_gmock(test_baz test/test_baz.cpp)
medkit_add_pytest_test(test_py test/test_py.py)
medkit_add_launch_test(test_bar test/test_bar.test.py TIMEOUT 90)
```

There is no table, no per-package pool and no size to keep an eye on. Adding a test to a
package is registering it, and nothing else.

Each of those macros wraps the test's command in `medkit_domain_runner.py`, which replaces
ament's `run_test.py`: it takes a domain, exports it, runs the test, and releases the domain
when the test process ends - including when it is killed, because the release is the kernel
closing a socket. The lock itself is `domain_coordinator.domain_id` from `ament_cmake_ros`,
which binds a TCP socket on `32768 + domain`. Because it is an OS-level lock rather than a
CTest property, it reaches across the separate `ctest` runs colcon starts per package, which
is what a `RESOURCE_LOCK` never could.

A test that needs several domains at once - a multi-gateway test running a second and a third
gateway - asks for them with `DOMAINS <n>`. The first arrives as `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` and the rest
as `MEDKIT_SECONDARY_DOMAINS`, which `ros2_medkit_test_utils.constants.get_test_domain_id`
reads. All of them are held by that test alone.

```cmake
medkit_add_launch_test(test_peer_aggregation test/test_peer_aggregation.test.py DOMAINS 4)
```

For a test that builds its own command line and so cannot take an ament test runner, there is
`medkit_add_wrapped_test(<name> [DOMAINS <n>] COMMAND <cmd...>)`, which puts
`medkit_run_with_domain.py` in front of the command instead.

Only domains **1-100 and 215-231** are drawn from. RTPS gives a domain the UDP slice
`[7400 + 250 * d, 7400 + 250 * d + 249]`, and the kernel hands out ephemeral ports from
`net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` (32768-60999 by default), which covers domains 101-214. If an
unrelated process is given one of those ports first, the node dies at startup with
`failed to bind to ANY:<port>: address in use` and every case in the file fails at once.
Domain 0 stays free because it is the ROS 2 default a developer shell uses, and 232 is
dropped because its slice runs past 65535. The full derivation, per DDS implementation, is in
`scripts/medkit_domain.py`.

That is 117 domains. `scripts/test.sh` runs `colcon test` with `ctest -j $(nproc)` inside
each package, so more tests than that can be in flight at once on a large machine; a test
that finds the band full waits for a domain rather than failing, up to
`MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAIN_WAIT` seconds (180 by default). What it never does is fall back to a
literal or to domain 0.

`MEDKIT_TEST_DOMAINS` is appended to the test's `ENVIRONMENT`, so a caller adding its own
entries must use `set_property(TEST ... APPEND PROPERTY ENVIRONMENT ...)`. A plain
`set_tests_properties(... PROPERTIES ENVIRONMENT ...)` afterwards drops it, and the check
below says so.

The failure this scheme has to guard against is silent: a test registered with plain
`ament_add_gtest` or `add_launch_test` does not fail, it runs on domain 0 and sees every node
on the machine. Two gates catch it, and neither has to be asked for:

- `test_dds_domain_allocation`, registered in every package automatically by the extras hook
  behind `find_package(ros2_medkit_cmake)`. It runs on the machine that *tests*, reads back
  the generated CTest properties, and fails on any test whose command does not go through
  the wrapper. Nothing in a package's `CMakeLists.txt` registers it, which is the point: a
  gate a package has to opt into is a gate the next package will not have.
- `test_dds_domain_coverage`, registered once by this package, which sweeps every package
  build directory in the workspace and applies the same rule - including to packages that
  never found `ros2_medkit_cmake` and so carry no gate of their own. A package with tests
  and no gate is reported by name.

A test that genuinely creates no ROS entities says so at its own call site:

```cmake
add_test(NAME core_only COMMAND $<TARGET_FILE:test_core_only>)
set_tests_properties(core_only PROPERTIES LABELS "unit")
medkit_test_needs_no_domain(core_only)   # after the LABELS assignment, which replaces
```

The package's own suite proves the parts that matter: that the band is what it says it is,
that a port held by an unrelated process is stepped over rather than fatal, that an exhausted
band is reported rather than downgraded, that excess holders wait and are served as domains
free up, that a wrapper killed with `SIGKILL` frees its domain, and - with the control that
makes the zero mean something - that two independently allocated ROS nodes hear nothing from
each other while the same two on one domain hear each other fine.

## Usage

In your package's `CMakeLists.txt`, before the first target:

```cmake
find_package(ros2_medkit_cmake REQUIRED)
include(ROS2MedkitCompat)
include(ROS2MedkitCcache)
include(ROS2MedkitSanitizers)
include(ROS2MedkitCoverage)
include(ROS2MedkitLinting)
include(ROS2MedkitWarnings)
```

Add to `package.xml`:

```xml
<buildtool_depend>ros2_medkit_cmake</buildtool_depend>
```

The cmake modules are automatically available via ament's extras hook after `find_package`.
