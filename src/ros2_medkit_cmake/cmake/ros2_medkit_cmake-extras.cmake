# Arm the DDS domain gate for this package, without the package asking for it.
#
# A test registered without the domain wrapper does not fail, it runs on the
# default domain 0 and shares it with every process on the machine. A gate that
# only runs where somebody remembered to register it cannot catch that: the next
# package added would be outside it and nothing would say so. So the gate rides
# on find_package(ros2_medkit_cmake) instead, which every package already does.
#
# Deferred rather than registered here: this hook runs before any of the
# package's tests exist, and in several packages before ament_cmake has defined
# BUILD_TESTING. cmake_language(DEFER) runs the registration at the end of the
# directory, by which time both are settled. It needs CMake 3.19; the oldest
# distro we build for ships 3.22.
